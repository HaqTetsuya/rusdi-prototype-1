## Training the Model

Before running the chatbot, you need to train the IndoBERT model. Use the provided Colab notebook for training:

[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HaqTetsuya/ChatbotPerpusBipa/blob/main/path_to_colab_notebook.ipynb)

1. Open the Colab notebook by clicking the badge above.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the model:
   - Upload your dataset.
   - Preprocess the data.
   - Train and save the model to .
3. Download the trained model and place it in the appropriate directory in the project /py/indobert_intent_model/.
