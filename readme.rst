ChatbotPerpusBipa
=================

ChatbotPerpusBipa is a chatbot designed for the library system of STMIK BINA PATRIA. It is built using **CodeIgniter 3** and **IndoBERT** for natural language processing. The repository contains scripts and models to create and deploy the chatbot.

---

Features
--------

- Chatbot system for library for STMIK BINA PATRIA
- Built with CodeIgniter 3 for backend
- Utilizes IndoBERT for NLP tasks (Indonesian language support)

---

Setup Instructions
------------------

1. Clone the repository:

::

    git clone https://github.com/HaqTetsuya/ChatbotPerpusBipa.git
    cd ChatbotPerpusBipa

2. Install required Python libraries:

::

    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Set up the CodeIgniter framework:

   - Place the PHP files in a web server directory (e.g., ``htdocs`` for XAMPP).
   - Configure the database in ``application/config/database.php``.

4. Ensure your environment is configured for PHP and Python integration.
