Kit Philipson has always felt like something of a stranger in his family. Growing up as the only child of professional parents in Glasgow, Scotland, he had every advantage. His mother was a teacher; his father, a journalist, escaped from Nazi Germany at the age of three on one of the 1939 Kindertransports. But on her deathbed, Kit’s mother tells him he was adopted and that his birth name was Novello. Soon, vague memories of his early life begin to surface: his nursery, pictures on the wall, the smell of his birth mother when she’d been cooking. And, sometimes, there are more disturbing memories—of strangers taking him by the hand and leading him away from the only family he had ever known. A search of old newspaper files reveals that a three-year-old boy named Peter Novello was abducted from his parents’ holiday hotel in Sicily in 1989. Now the young man who has known himself only as Kit sets out to rediscover his past, the story of two three-year-old boys torn from their mothers in very different circumstances. Kit’s probing inquiries are sure to bring surprises. They may also unearth dangerous secrets that dare never be revealed. With sharp wit and deep insight, Robert Barnard sweeps away all preconceptions in this powerful study of maternal love and the danger of obsession."," Fiction , Mystery & Detective , Traditional British",2010

LOST AND FOUND: A Woman Revisits Eighth Grade,"By Israeloff, Roberta","When Roberta Israeloff opened her eighth-grade diary for the first time in thirty years, she discovered it wasn't an easy read. Its pages took her back to a critical year in the tumultuous, treacherous passages of adolescence - the time, in Carol Gilligan's words, ""when girls are in danger of drowning or disappearing.""Israeloff didn't drown that year - her grades didn't plummet, she didn't seriously rebel - nor did she disappear. But the metamorphosis she underwent was no less profound for being a quiet one. The ambitious, athletic, competitive ""tomboy"" who loved math and science was transformed into an introverted, tentative young woman who had discovered the love of words that would make her a writer but had lost the bold, unconstrained voice of her childhood.With her journal entries as a point of entry, Israeloff relives that watershed year and the turnings it marked in her sexual, emotional, and intellectual identity. Reaching back in time and forward to her present as a writer, wife, and mother, she has woven a searching account of the bittersweet realities of growing up female, one that will resonate with women of all ages."," Self-help , Affirmations",1996

"Ship of Ghosts: The Story of the USS Houston, FDR's Legendary Lost Cruiser, and the Epic Saga of Her Survivors","By Hornfischer, James D.","NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER""Son, we’re going to Hell."" The navigator of the USS Houston confided these prophetic  words to a young officer as he and his captain charted a course into U.S. naval legend.  Renowned as FDR’s favorite warship, the cruiser USS Houston was a prize target trapped  in the far Pacific after Pearl Harbor. Without hope of reinforcement, her crew faced  a superior Japanese force ruthlessly committed to total conquest. It wasn’t a fair  fight, but the men of the Houston would wage it to the death. Hornfischer brings  to life the awesome terror of nighttime naval battles that turned decks into strobe-lit  slaughterhouses, the deadly rain of fire from Japanese bombers, and the almost superhuman  effort of the crew as they miraculously escaped disaster again and again–until their  luck ran out during a daring action in Sunda Strait. There, hopelessly outnumbered,  the Houston was finally sunk and its survivors taken prisoner. For more than three  years their fate would be a mystery to families waiting at home. In the brutal privation  of jungle POW camps dubiously immortalized in such films as The Bridge on the River  Kwai, the war continued for the men of the Houston—a life-and-death struggle to survive  forced labor, starvation, disease, and psychological torture. Here is the gritty,  unvarnished story of the infamous Burma–Thailand Death Railway glamorized by Hollywood,  but which in reality mercilessly reduced men to little more than animals, who fought  back against their dehumanization with dignity, ingenuity, sabotage, will–power—and  the undying faith that their country would prevail. Using journals and letters,  rare historical documents, including testimony from postwar Japanese war crimes tribunals,  and the eyewitness accounts of Houston’s survivors, James Hornfischer has crafted  an account of human valor so riveting and awe-inspiring, it’s easy to forget that  every single word is true."," History , Military , Naval",2007

The Gastronomy of Marriage: A Memoir of Food and Love,"By Maisto, Michelle","“On our first date, Rich ordered a chocolate soufflé at the beginning of the meal, noting an asterisk on the menu warning diners of the wait involved. At the time, I imagined he did it partly to impress me, which it did, though today I know well that he’s simply the type of man who knows better than to turn down a hot-from-the-oven soufflé when one is offered to him.”When Michelle Maisto meets Rich–like her, a closet writer with a fierce love of books and good food–their single-mindedness at the table draws them together, and meals become a stage for their long courtship. Finally engaged, they move in together, but sitting down to shared meals each night–while working at careers, trying to write, and falling into the routines that come to define a home–soon feels like something far different from their first dinner together.Who cooks, who shops, who does the dishes? Rich craves the light fare his mother learned to prepare as a girl in China, but Michelle leans toward the hearty dishes her father knew as a boy in Italy. Rich eats meat, but Michelle doesn’t. His metabolism races through carbohydrates, hers holds to them tightly. And while her idea of a quick meal is a fried egg, his is to head to a restaurant. After Rich takes additional work to pay for their wedding, Michelle offers to do his half of the cooking chores–which, along with the newness of their living together, challenges her feelings about the kitchen and what it means to be a modern wife.As they save and plan for a wedding, the nightly compromises, small generosities, and stubborn stakings of ground that take place around the dinner table offer a context in which Maisto considers what she’s learned from the marriages around her, and what she and Rich might create for themselves."," Cooking , Essays & Narratives",2009

In direct, straightforward, and at times strikingly lyrical prose, Jamison looks back at her relationship with her husband, Richard Wyatt, a renowned scientist who battled debilitating dyslexia to become one of the foremost experts on schizophrenia. And with her characteristic honesty, candor, wit, and simplicity, she describes his death, her own long, difficult struggle with grief, and her efforts to distinguish grief from depression.But she also recalls the great joy that Richard brought her during the nearly twenty years they had together. Wryly humorous anecdotes mingle with bittersweet memories of a relationship that was passionate and loving—if troubled on occasion by her manic-depressive (bipolar) illness—as Jamison reveals the ways in which her husband encouraged her to write openly about her mental illness and, through his courage and grace taught her to live fully.A penetrating psychological study of grief viewed from deep inside the experience itself, Nothing Was the Same is also a deeply moving memoir by a superb writer."," Family & Relationships , Death, Grief, Bereavement",2009

God at Your Wits' End: Hope for Wherever You Are,"By Meberg, Marilyn","The good news about being at our wits' end is that God meets us there.To be human is to spend some time at our wits' end?in confusion, desperation, pain, and fear. In that difficult place, we long for a tangible, visible sign that God hears our cries and is actively working for good in our lives.

I thought I was forgiven.Why is faith so hard? What if I don't have enough?Why does God allow suffering?In God at Your Wits' End, Marilyn Meberg helps us cut through the mental clutter and confusion that lead to faulty thinking and shaky faith. She tenderly acknowledges our trials by revealing her own wits'-end experiences; then she points the way to rescue and respite by sharing the scriptural truths of God's enduring love and sovereign power."," Religion , Faith",2005

The Great Depression Ahead: How to Prosper in the Crash Following the Greatest Boom in History,"By Dent, Harry S.","The first and last economic depression that you will experience in your lifetime is just ahead. The year 2009 will be the beginning of the next long-term winter season and the initial end of prosperity in almost every market, ushering in a downturn like most of us have not experienced before. Are you aware that we have seen long-term peaks in our stock market and economy very close to every 40 years due to generational spending trends: as in 1929, 1968, and next around 2009? Are you aware that oil and commodity prices have peaked nearly every 30 years, as in 1920, 1951, 1980 -- and next likely around late 2009 to mid-2010? The three massive bubbles that have been booming for the last few decades -- stocks, real estate, and commodities -- have all reached their peak and are deflating simultaneously.Bestselling author and renowned economic forecaster Harry S. Dent, Jr., has observed these trends for decades. As he first demonstrated in his bestselling The Great Boom Ahead, he has developed analytical techniques that allow him to predict the impact they will have. The Great Depression Ahead explains ""The Perfect Storm"" as peak oil prices collide with peaking generational spending trends by 2010, leading to a more severe downtrend for the global economy and individual investors alike.He predicts the following:? The economy appears to recover from the subprime crisis and minor recession by mid-2009 -- ""the calm before the real storm.""? Stock prices start to crash again between mid- and late 2009 into late 2010, and likely finally bottom around mid-2012 -- between Dow 3,800 and 7,200.? The economy enters a deeper depression between mid-2010 and early 2011, likely extending off and on into late 2012 or mid-2013.? Asian markets may bottom by late 2010, along with health care, and be the first great buy opportunities in stocks.? Gold and precious metals will appear to be a hedge at first, but will ultimately collapse as well after mid- to late 2010.? A first major stock rally, likely between mid-2012 and mid-2017, will be followed by a final setdback around late 2019/early 2020.? The next broad-based global bull market will be from 2020-2023 into 2035-2036.Conventional investment wisdom will no longer apply, and investors on every level -- from billion-dollar firms to the individual trader -- must drastically reevaluate their policies in order to survive. But despite the dire news and dark predictions, there are real opportunities to come from the greatest fire sale on financial assets since the early 1930s. Dent outlines the critical issues that will face our government and other major institutions, offering long- and short-term tactics for weathering the storm. He offers recommendations that will allow families, businesses, investors, and individuals to manage their assets correctly and come out on top. With the right knowledge and preparation, you can take advantage of new wealth opportunities rather than get caught in a downward spiral. Your life is about to change for reasons outside of your control. You can't change the direction of the winds, but you can reset your sails!"," Business & Economics , Forecasting",2009

Good Health For African Americans,"By Wilson, Josleen and Dixon, Barbara M.","Good Health for African Americans is the first and only book dedicated to improving the health of all black Americans, written by a nationally recognized nutritionist and dynamic health educator. It defines all the complex issues that account for the enormous health gap between black and white Americans at every income level, along with a self-help program for improving health. The most current information, guidelines, and solutions to personal health problems appear nowhere else.There is a crisis in black health. African Americans live six years less than the national average and that difference is increasing. In her daily work, Barbara Dixon sees the excessive toll that diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, addictions, stress, and other major disorders take on the lives of black Americans. This disproportionate health statistic is tied to both past and present causes. Historical research traces modern health problems to the moment when the first African was captured for the slave trade. Slavery, emancipation, and modern life are all in the background of today's health picture.Dixon's message is clear and simple: By adopting a special diet as well as lifestyle changes, black Americans can begin to increase their chances for a long and robust life. Sankofa - an expression found among many West African languages, meaning ""learning from the past and building for the future"" - is a program that combines the healthful aspects of African-American life with the benefits of appropriate nutrition (including soul-food makeovers!), vitamins, proper exercise, and sound advice on how to relinquish risky behaviors.The goal of this truly pioneer book is to identify where history, stress, eating habits, poor medical care, rage, and racism all meet and begin to reverse their effects. All African Americans face heightened health risks, but no group has more to gain by taking charge of its own future good health."," Health & Fitness , Health Care Issues",1993

Just Walk Across the Room Participant's Guide: Four Sessions on Simple Steps Pointing People to Faith (Zondervangroupware),"By Hybels, Bill and Wiersma, Ashley","Building on the solid foundation laid in Becoming a Contagious Christian, Just Walk Across the Room signals the next era in personal evangelism. Pastor Bill Hybels’s firm conviction is that the highest value in personal evangelism is being attuned to and cooperative with the promptings of the Holy Spirit. This means playing only the role you are intended to play—walking when the Spirit says to walk, talking when the Spirit says to talk, and falling silent when the Spirit suggests that you’ve already said enough. More than two thousand years ago, Jesus himself introduced the perfect model for evangelism. He left the marvelous adoration of the angels and the perfection of heaven, and he chose to “walk” clear across the cosmos. He had no memorized script, no forced formulas. Instead, he was armed only with an offer of redemption to people just like you and me, many of whom were neck-deep in pain of their own making. Today, the goal for every Christian is to reflect Christ’s love and follow his example by taking simple walks across rooms—leaving our circles of comfort and extending hands of care, compassion, and inclusiveness to people living far from God. Hybels encourages Christ-followers to “live in 3-D”—developing friendships, discovering stories, and discerning appropriate next steps—as a means of learning to understand the Spirit’s promptings. With fresh perspectives from his own reflections and experiences collected during his most recent decade of ministry. Hybels shows with undeniable clarity the power of this approach to evangelism. The stakes are high. The implications are eternal. And you may be only a conversation away from having unparalleled impact on someone’s life—if you will just walk across the room."," Religion , Christian Ministry , Evangelism",2006

The Corporate Closet: The Professional Lives of Gay Men in America,"By Woods, James D. and Lucas, Jay H.","While most of us believe that professional conduct is, or should be, asexual, corporate America is in fact suffused with sexual assumptions. From its offices to its boardrooms, heterosexuality is continuously on display: alluded to in conversation and family photos, symbolized by wedding rings, and endorsed by personnel policies that award benefits to spouses and children. For the estimated ten percent of the population that is gay, including the millions of gay professionals in the corporate world, the ""sexual culture"" of these organizations forces a series of difficult choices.Now, drawing on hundreds of interviews with men all across the country and in different kinds of companies, from chief executives to recent college graduates, James Woods explores the professional lives of gay men and the various strategies they have developed for managing sexual identity at work. Whether they disguise their sexuality, reveal it, or try to avoid the subject altogether, each choice has its consequences and benefits and has profound implications for their careers, their companies, and their colleagues. This pathbreaking book explores the significance of each alternative, and in tracing the process by which gay men make the choice it illuminates the stressful realities of gay life in corporate America.In the short run, it is the men's self-esteem, productivity, and job satisfaction that suffer from the struggle of accommodating to heterosexual norms. But in the long run, the sexual culture of the workplace affects all professionals. Woods' fascinating inquiry explores the dynamics of sexuality in professional life and the way it shapes our own self-definitions, values, and most deeply held ideas about work. As the workplace becomes increasingly diverse, it is time for us to look more closely at the boundaries between the sexual and the professional, and the many ways in which these worlds overlap."," Social Science , LGBT Studies , Gay Studies",1993

Untapped: The Scramble for Africa's Oil,"By Ghazvinian, John","Although Africa has long been known to be rich in oil, extracting it hadn’t seemed worth the effort and risk until recently. But with the price of Middle Eastern crude oil skyrocketing and advancing technology making reserves easier to tap, the region has become the scene of a competition between major powers that recalls the nineteenth-century scramble for colonization there. Already the United States imports more of its oil from Africa than from Saudi Arabia, and China, too, looks to the continent for its energy security. What does this giddy new oil boom mean—for America, for the world, for Africans themselves? To find out, John Ghazvinian traveled through twelve African countries—from Sudan to Congo to Angola—talking to warlords, industry executives, bandits, activists, priests, missionaries, oil-rig workers, scientists, and ordinary people whose lives have been transformed—not necessarily for the better—by the riches beneath their feet. The result is a high-octane narrative that reveals the challenges, obstacles, reasons for despair, and reasons for hope emerging from the world’s newest energy hot spot."," Technology & Engineering , Petroleum",2007

Nine Crazy Ideas in Science (Few Might Even Be True),"By Ehrlich, Robert","AIDS is not caused by HIV. Coal and oil are not fossil fuels. Radiation exposure is good for you. Distributing more guns reduces crime. These ideas make headlines, but most educated people scoff at them. Yet some of science's most important concepts-from gravity to evolution-have surfaced from the pool of crazy ideas. In fact, a good part of science is distinguishing between useful crazy ideas and those that are just plain nutty. In this book, a well-known physicist with an affinity for odd ideas applies his open mind to nine controversial propositions on topical subjects. Some, it turns out, are considerably lower on the cuckoo scale than others.  Robert Ehrlich evaluates, for the general reader or student, nine seemingly far-out propositions culled from physics, biology, and social science. In the process, he demonstrates in easy-to-understand terms how to weigh an argument, judge someone's use of statistics, identify underlying assumptions, and ferret out secret agendas. His conclusions are sometimes surprising. For instance, he finds that while HIV does cause AIDS and the universe almost certainly started with a big bang, our solar system could have two suns, faster-than-light particles might exist, and time travel can't be ruled out as mere science fiction.  Anyone interested in unorthodox ideas will get a kick out of this book. And, as a fun way of learning how to think like a scientist, it has enormous educational value. Of course, only time will tell whether any of these nine ideas will be the next continental drift--the now orthodox account of the Earth's geology that was for years just a crazy idea."," Science , General",2002

Big Girls Don't Cry: The Election that Changed Everything for American Women,"By Traister, Rebecca","REBECCA TRAISTER, whose coverage of the 2008 presidential election for Salon confirmed her to be a gifted cultural observer, offers a startling appraisal of what the campaign meant for all of us. Though the election didn’t give us our first woman president or vice president, the exhilarating campaign was nonetheless transformative for American women and for the nation. In Big Girls Don’t Cry, her electrifying, incisive and highly entertaining first book, Traister tells a terrific story and makes sense of a moment in American history that changed the country’s narrative in ways that no one anticipated.It was all as unpredictable as it was riveting: Hillary Clinton’s improbable rise, her fall and her insistence (to the consternation of her party and the media) on pushing forward straight through to her remarkable phoenix flight from the race; Sarah Palin’s attempt not only to fill the void left by Clinton, but to alter the very definition of feminism and claim some version of it for conservatives; liberal rapture over Barack Obama and the historic election of our first African-American president; the media microscope trained on Michelle Obama, harsher even than the one Hillary had endured fifteen years earlier. Meanwhile, media women like Katie Couric and Rachel Maddow altered the course of the election, and comedians like Tina Fey and Amy Poehler helped make feminism funny. What did all this mean to the millions of people who were glued to their TV sets, and for the country, its history and its future? As Traister sees it, the 2008 election was good for women. The campaign for the presidency reopened some of the most fraught American conversations—about gender, race and generational difference, about sexism on the left and feminism on the right—difficult discussions that had been left unfinished but that are crucial to further perfecting our union. The election was also catalytic, shaping the perspectives of American women and men from different generations and backgrounds, altering the way that all of us will approach questions of women and power far into the future. When Clinton cried, when Palin reached for her newborn at the end of a vice presidential debate, when Couric asked a series of campaign-ending questions, the whole country was watching women’s history—American history—being made. Throughout, Traister weaves in her own experience as a thirtysomething feminist sorting through all the events and media coverage—vacillating between Clinton and Obama and forced to face tough questions about her own feminism, the women’s movement, race and the different generational perspectives of women working toward political parity some ninety years after their sex was first enfranchised. It was a time of enormous change, and there is no better guide through that explosive, infuriating, heartbreaking and sometimes hilarious year than Rebecca Traister. Big Girls Don’t Cry offers an enduring portrait of dramatic cultural and political shifts brought about by this most historic of American contests."," Political Science , Political Process , Campaigns & Elections",2010

Yearnings: Embracing the Sacred Messiness of Life,"By Kula, Irwin and Loewenthal, Linda","""Irwin Kula shows us how to to live our humanness -- the pleasures and the challenges, the messiness and the triumphs -- with a profound acceptance of our desires and foibles and a joy that can only come from understanding."" --Deepak Chopra ""Yearning. After twenty-three years as a rabbi, I can think of no more defining human experience."" Life can be messy and imperfect. We're all looking for answers. And yet, as renowned rabbi Irwin Kula points out, the yearning for answers is no different now than it was in the times that gave rise to Moses, Buddha, and Jesus. Far from being a burden, however, these yearnings can themselves become a path to blessing, prompting questions and insights, resulting in new ways of being and believing. In this, his first book, Rabbi Kula takes us on an excursion into the depths of our desires, applying ancient Jewish tradition to seven of our most wonderful yearnings. Merging ancient wisdom with contemporary insights, Rabbi Kula shows how traditional practices can inform and enrich our own search for meaning. More importantly, he invites us to embrace the messiness and complexities of the human experience in order to fully embrace the endless and glorious project of life."," Religion , Judaism , General",2006

Its helpful, down-to-earth advice can transform any leader from merely good to positively outstanding.

Protectionism (Ohlin Lectures),"By Bhagwati, Jagdish N.","A leading international economist looks at many of the key issues of trade policy now confronting the United States and the world in this timely book. Clear, informative, and witty, Jagdish Bhagwati provides the best available analysis of the protection debate and offers a prescription for reform in this turbulent area of trade policy. Bhagwati identifies new and powerful interests and ideologies that are likely to dominate the outcome of the debate. He argues that opposing tendencies can be identified in trade-related ideologies and in the national and sectional interests that lobby on trade policy in pluralistic societies. He offers the prognosis that the forces favoring freer trade are more robust and more fundamental than the forces of protectionism, and that pro trade forces are likely to triumph in the end but only if we adapt appropriately the institutions within which these ideologies and interests must function. Through an appealing combination of text, quotations, cartoons, tables, charts, and graphs, Bhagwati provides a masterly and entertaining look at the forces for and against protection.Protectionism is based on the inaugural series of Ohlin Lectures, which he delivered at the Stockholm School of Economics in October of 1987."," Business & Economics , International , Economics",1989

"Dreaming in Chinese: Mandarin Lessons In Life, Love, And Language","By Fallows, Deborah","Deborah Fallows has spent much of her life learning languages and traveling around the world. But nothing prepared her for the surprises of learning Mandarin, China's most common language, or the intensity of living in Shanghai and Beijing. Over time, she realized that her struggles and triumphs in studying the language of her adopted home provided small clues to deciphering the behavior and habits of its people,and its culture's conundrums. As her skill with Mandarin increased, bits of the language—a word, a phrase, an oddity of grammar—became windows into understanding romance, humor, protocol, relationships, and the overflowing humanity of modern China.Fallows learned, for example, that the abrupt, blunt way of speaking that Chinese people sometimes use isn't rudeness, but is, in fact, a way to acknowledge and honor the closeness between two friends. She learned that English speakers' trouble with hearing or saying tones—the variations in inflection that can change a word's meaning—is matched by Chinese speakers' inability not to hear tones, or to even take a guess at understanding what might have been meant when foreigners misuse them.In sharing what she discovered about Mandarin, and how those discoveries helped her understand a culture that had at first seemed impenetrable, Deborah Fallows's Dreaming in Chinese opens up China to Westerners more completely, perhaps, than it has ever been before."," Language Arts & Disciplines , Linguistics , Sociolinguistics",2010

Camouflage and Mimicry (Phoenix Series),"By Owen, Denis Frank","Many organisms, to avoid being noticed, combine color and shape to create elaborate and highly effective disguises. Some have evolved uncanny likenesses to such elements of their environment as leaves and rocks. Others use color and shape in more spectacular displays simply to frighten a predator or to warn that they are poisonous. In turn, and to complicate matters for their enemies, some edible animals have evolved a striking likeness to poisonous animals that use color as a warning. Though such camouflage and mimicry is most widely and brilliantly evident among the insects—where sometimes only the experienced naturalist can see through the deception—it has also evolved in plants and several groups of vertebrates, including birds, snakes, and salamanders.Camouflage and Mimicry describes the remarkably varied attempts of species to deceive their predators and prey. It illustrates a group of strategies which help to increase an individual's chances of survival."," Science , Life Sciences , Ecology",1982

Health and Human Values: A Guide to Making your own Decisions,"By Harron, Frank","Although modern developments in medical science have produced some dramatic benefits, they have also raised difficult and sometimes controversial moral and legal questions. How much information should a physician give to a patient? If preserving life means increasing suffering, should every means be exercised to prolong life? Should we screen the population and reduce the reproductive freedom of individuals with genetic diseases? In an era of staggering increases in health care costs, should the new medical benefits go to those who can afford them or should the government devise systems that distribute risks and benefits more equally?Frank Harron, John Burnside, and Tom Beauchamp examine these and many other questions confronted today by health care professionals, patients and their families, policy makers, and all informed, responsible citizens. They explore such provocative problems as euthanasia, abortion, in vitro fertilization, health care and distributive justice, truth-telling and informed consent, determination of death, and genetic engineering. Their approach reaches behind the headlines and beyond the controversy to enable the reader to make his or her own informed decisions. Each chapter contains actual case studies followed by questions that highlight the dilemmas embedded in the case. The main portion of the chapter provides background examination of key medical, philosophical, legal, and public policy factors. Excerpts from leading writers in medicine, law, theology, and philosophy and an annotated bibliography of other printed and audio/visual resources are provided for every topic. The capabilities that medical science has provided have come upon us before we are ready with a working consensus. Each person must find his or her own bearings in this era of rapid transition in values and then contribute to society’s struggle to make fair and enlightened laws and policies. This book assists the reader to cope and to participate in the crucial, even vital, decisions we all face."," Medical , Ethics",1983

He explains why the United States is now the ""borrower and spender of last resort,"" makes the case that this is an untenable arrangement, and argues that global economic security depends on the ability of emerging economies to develop robust financial systems based on domestic currencies.Sharply and clearly argued, Wolf’s prescription for fixing global finance illustrates why he has been described as ""the world's preeminent financial journalist."""," Business & Economics , Development , Economic Development",2008

When You and Your Mother Can't Be Friends: Resolving the Most Complicated Relationship of Your Life,"By Secunda, Victoria","“A book of great value for every daughter and every mother; useful for sons, too.”—Benjamin Spock, M.D. From the Introduction:The goal of this book is to help readers achieve that separation so that they can either find a way to be friends with their mothers, or at least recognize and accept that their mothers did the best they could—even if it wasn't “good enough”—and to stop blaming them. Among the issues to be covered: • To understand how a daughter's attachment to her mother—more so than her relationship with her father—colors all her other relationships, and to analyze why it is more difficult for daughters than sons to separate from their mothers, as well as why daughters are more subject than sons to a mother's manipulation• To recognize the difference between a healthy and a destructive mother-daughter connection, and to define clearly the “bad mommy,” in order to help readers who have trouble acknowledging their childhood losses to begin to comprehend them• To conjugate what I call the “Bad Mommy Taboo”—why our culture is more eager to protect the sanctity of maternity than it is to protect emotionally abused daughters • To describe the evolution of the ""unpleasable"" mother—in all likelihood, she was bereft of maternal love as a child—and to recognize the huge, and often poignant, stake she has in keeping her grown daughter dependent and off-balance• To illustrate the consequent controlling behavior—in some cases, cloaked in fragility or good intentions—of such mothers, which falls into general patterns, including: the Doormat, the Critic, the Smotherer, the Avenger, the Deserter • To understand that the daughter has a similar stake in either being a slave to or hating her mother—the two sides of her depen dency and immaturity • To illustrate the responsive behavior—and survival mechanisms —of daughters, which is determined in part by such variables as birth rank, family history, and temperament, and which also falls into patterns, including: the Angel, the Superachiever, the Cipher, the Troublemaker, the Defector • To show how to redefine the mother-daughter relationship, so that each can learn to see and accept the other as she is today, appreciating each other's good qualities and not being snared by the bad• Finally, to demonstrate that a redefined relationship with one's mother—adult to adult—frees you from the past, whether that re definition ultimately results in real friendship, affectionate truce, or divorce."," Family & Relationships , Parenting , Motherhood",1991

Were it not for the delicious Brenda Bodkin, his publicist, and their endlessly unconsummated passion, his life would be very dull indeed.One day, Felix receives a tape in the mail which reveals the sad tale of Gavin, a man whose life was destroyed by PROD, the Parental Rights and Obligations Department. Shortly thereafter, Felix again hears Gavin, now on a radio phone-in, and a few days later meets him at a book-signing. Gavin introduces the author to Miriam, who assures Felix that he is the father of her child, Ian. Before Felix knows it, he is in receipt of a huge bill for Ian's maintenance and, as if that weren't shocking enough, he soon finds himself the chief suspect in a murder case.To discover the identity of the murderer, our hero has no choice but to enter the underworld and live among the down-and-outs of London. There among the rubbish and the smell of poverty he finds friendship and unexpected grace."," Fiction , Mystery & Detective , Traditional",1997
Churchill on Leadership: Executive Success in the Face of Adversity,"By Hayward, Steven F.","Success often depends on the strength of a single quality: leadership. Winston Churchill is universally recognized as one of the 20th century's great political leaders and his words ring just as true in the world of commerce. A wise, witty, and inspiring leader, Churchill ran Great Britain like a great corporation.""Perhaps the finest book on practical leadership ever written."" — Brian TracyChurchill on Leadership demonstrates that the principles that guided Churchill ably translate to private industry today. Author Steven F. Hayward gives strong evidence that, if you remove Churchill from his political context, he would have the resume to be among the great business leaders of any age. Churchill: • was a financier (as chancellor of the Exechequer) and labor negotiator (as home secretary)• managed a large transportation network (as head of the British Navy) and far-flung property holdings (as colonial secretary)• persevered through bankruptcies and other financial disasters• conceived and introduced innovative new products over the opposition of his colleagues, and reorganized major production operations in the midst of crisis.With wit and insight, Hayward reveals Churchill's secrets for business success from assembling and inspiring a first-rate team to preparing a wise budget, from communicating a vision to structuring effective meetings, from acting decisively to rebounding from a failure. Laced with epochal events from the historical stage, enlivened with stimulating speculation, and leavened with wit,Churchill on Leadership is both an enjoyable read and a thought-provoking lesson on leadership.From the Trade Paperback edition."," History , Europe , Great Britain",1997

After surgery and several years of rehab, Baker, who in high school was a top prospect for the U.S. Olympic team, put his successful journalism career on hold to attempt the seemingly impossible: a comeback. He moved away from his family to become the third-string goalie for the Bakersfield Condors, an AA-level minor-league team in the dusty oil town of Bakersfield, California.

When the season is over, Baker's pro-hockey adventure ends up teaching him nearly everything he will ever need to know about life."," Sports & Recreation , Hockey",2003

Blue Genes: A Memoir of Loss and Survival,"By Lukas, Christopher","Tony and I are brothers across the stroboscopic echoes of the past: dissolving across black interludes into the next image, and the next, and the next, until all vestige of pure vision is destroyed. All that is left is memory, and we know how faulty that can be. Who Tony was is forever blurred by who I was and how I remember who I thought Tony was . . . He is dead, and I am alive—left to dwell on questions, and to seek the answers . . .Would I, too, end up killing myself? Was the legacy of self-destruction I would discover in my family too great for me to survive? If so, when would the pendulum swing? And, if it never did, why not? How could I—almost alone among my family—escape? —From Blue GenesThis courageous, engrossing memoir explores the complex and shattering effects of a family legacy of depression and suicide on the author and his brother, the award-winning journalist, J. Anthony Lukas. Christopher (Kit) Lukas’s mother committed suicide when he was a boy. He and his brother, Tony, were not told how she died. No one spoke of the family’s history of depression and bipolar disorder. The legacy of guilt and grief haunted Kit and Tony throughout their lives.Both brothers achieved remarkable success, Tony as a gifted journalist, Kit as an accomplished television producer and director. After suffering bouts of depression, Kit was able to confront his family’s troubled past, drawing on his experience to write Silent Grief, an invaluable guide to surviving a loved one’s suicide. Tony forged a sterling career, eventually winning two Pulitzer Prizes, including one for the now-classic book Common Ground. But he never seemed to find the contentment Kit had attained; he remained creative, but depressed. In 1997, shortly before the publication of his acclaimed book, Big Trouble, Tony Lukas committed suicide.Blue Genes portrays the lives of two brothers who alternately locked horns and found solace in each other. Written with heartrending candor, it captures the devastation of this family legacy of depression, but it is also surprisingly uplifting, as it details the strength and hope that can provide a way of escaping its grasp."," Psychology , Psychopathology , Depression",2008
The Einstein Scrapbook,"By Rosenkranz, Ze'Ev","Einstein is the personification of supreme intellect, his name synonymous with genius. His scientific theories revolutionized the way we look at reality itself. His legacy of pacificism, Zionism, and social justice continues to inspire millions of people around the world. The Einstein Scrapbook offers a unique glimpse into the life and work of this remarkable man which will delight those for whom he is a hero and those familiar with him only as an icon. Featuring illuminating documents and photographs from his personal papers -- many published here for the first time -- it provides a kaleidoscope through which to see the great scientist and humanist anew.The book opens with an engaging and concise biography that explores Einstein's family history and education, his career as a scientist and educator, his complex marital relations, and his role as a father. In subsequent sections, The Einstein Scrapbook presents an overview of Einstein's scientific theories, from his breakthrough articles on the special theory of relativity, quantum theory, and Brownian motion published in 1905 -- his annus mirabilis -- through his revolutionary general theory of relativity in 1916 and his final quest for a unified field theory. The book also shows Einstein's role in the international peace movement and his views on social and economic justice, as well as his Jewish identity and his relationship to the Jewish people and the State of Israel, which culminated in his being offered the presidency of Israel in 1952. On the lighter side, this book chronicles Einstein's passion for music and sailing, his charming correspondence with children from around the world, and some of the curious letters he received from fans during his later years, and it concludes with a look at Einstein's mythic status. Drawn from the collection of the Hebrew University's Albert Einstein Archives, The Einstein Scrapbook perfectly reflects Einstein's brilliance, humor, generosity, and nobility.From The Einstein Scrapbook: ""Dear Elsa,...

For these reasons alone I should be unsuited to fulfill the duties of that high office, even if advancing age was not making increasing inroads on my strength.

Warriors Don't Cry: A Searing Memoir of the Battle to Integrate Little Rock's Central High,"By Beals, Melba Pattillo","In this compelling autobiographical account by one of the Civil Rights Movement’s most powerful figures, Beals explores not only the power of racism, but also the ideas of justice and identity.In 1957, well before Martin Luther King’s “I Have a Dream” speech, Melba Pattillo Beals and eight other teenagers became iconic symbols for the Civil Rights Movement and the dismantling of Jim Crow in the American South as they integrated Little Rock’s Central High School in the wake of the landmark 1954 Supreme Court ruling, Brown v. Board of Education. Throughout her harrowing ordeal, Melba was taunted by her schoolmates and their parents, threatened by a lynch mob’s rope, attacked with lighted sticks of dynamite, and injured by acid sprayed in her eyes. But through it all, she acted with dignity and courage, and refused to back down. Warriors Don’t Cry is, at times, a difficult but necessary reminder of the valuable lessons we can learn from our nation’s past. It is a story of courage and the bravery of a handful of young, black students who used their voices to influence change during a turbulent time."," Young Adult Nonfiction , People & Places , United States , General",2007

"In the Mind's Eye: Visual Thinkers, Gifted People With Dyslexia and Other Learning Difficulties, Computer Images and the Ironies of Creativity","By West, Thomas G.","This inspiring book profiles gifted individuals who used nontraditional methods in their work as it explodes many myths about conventional intelligence and charts new vistas for today's computer visualization technologies. Some of our most original intellects--Albert Einstein, Thomas Edison, Lewis Carroll, and Winston Churchill--relied heavily on visual modes of thought, processing information in terms of images instead of words or numbers. Thomas G. West examines the learning difficulties experienced by both famous and everyday people, and he explores how recent neurological research shows an association between visual talents and verbal difficulties. In the Mind's Eye probes new data on dyslexics to see how computers enhance the creative potential of visual thinkers, as well as interactive computer applications at all levels of education and work. Updated with a new preface, epilogue, and expanded notes, this volume could be the clarion call for educators and corporations to mine this untapped resource of highly creative talent in our midst."," Psychology , Cognitive Psychology & Cognition",1997

Married to the Brand: Why Consumers Bond with Some Brands for Life,"By McEwen, William J.","Packed with stories and compelling discoveries from an impressive worldwide consumer database, Married to the Brand reveals why consumers bond with some brands — but not others. Looking through the all-important eyes of the consumer, it shows what companies must do to build enduring and profitable brand relationships.Companies spend millions of dollars every year trying to court consumers. They invest in flashy advertising, celebrity endorsements, loyalty programs, Web sites . . . you name it. And they spend millions more trying to build their businesses through elaborate “relationship management” software. The result? Most marketers still aren’t emotionally connecting with consumers. Sure, their strategies may draw raves, and their ads may win impressive awards at Cannes. They may even raise their brand awareness. But they too often fail to build enduring brand relationships. Put another way: Many marketers are great at wooing a “first date” with consumers — yet lousy at creating a lasting marriage between buyer and brand. Married to the Brand tells the story of what makes profitable brand relationships work — through the eyes of the consumer, not the marketer. Packed with stories and compelling discoveries from a worldwide consumer database, this book explores why people bond with some brands and not others. Emotions aren’t simply warm, fluffy concepts. According to Married to the Brand, which draws on 60 years of Gallup Organization research into consumer psychology, emotional connections can be measured and managed. Married to the Brand shows you how. This is a must-read for profit-obsessed marketers everywhere — from the boardroom, where strategies are formulated, to the front lines, where employees “live” the brand every day."," Business & Economics , Consumer Behavior",2005

Animal Underworld,"By Green, Alan","A vast and previously undisclosed underground economy exists in the United States. The products bought and sold: animals. In Animal Underworld, veteran investigative journalist Alan Green exposes the sleazy, sometimes illegal web of those who trade in rare and exotic creatures. Green and The Center for Public Integrity reveal which American zoos and amusement parks dump their ""surplus"" animals on the middlemen adept at secretly redirecting them into the private pet trade. We're taken to exotic-animal auctions, where the anonymous high bidders are often notorious dealers, hunting-ranch proprietors, and profit-minded charlatans masquerading as conservationists. We visit some of the nation's most prestigious universities and research laboratories, whose   diseased monkeys are ""laundered"" through this same network of breeders and dealers until they finally reach the homes of unsuspecting pet owners. And we meet the men and women who make their living by skirting through loopholes in the law, or by ignoring the law altogether. For anyone who cares about animals; for pet owners, zoo-goers, wildlife conservationists, and animal   welfare advocates, Animal Underworld is gripping, shocking reading."," Nature , Animal Rights",1999

How the Mind Works,"By Pinker, Steven","In this extraordinary bestseller, Steven Pinker, one of the world's leading cognitive scientists, does for the rest of the mind what he did for language in his 1994 book, The Language Instinct. He explains what the mind is, how it evolved, and how it allows us to see, think, feel, laugh, interact, enjoy the arts, and ponder the mysteries of life. And he does it with the wit that prompted Mark Ridley to write in the New York Times Book Review, ""No other science writer makes me laugh so much. . . . [Pinker] deserves the superlatives that are lavished on him.""  The arguments in the book are as bold as its title. Pinker rehabilitates some unfashionable ideas, such as that the mind is a computer and that human nature was shaped by natural selection, and challenges fashionable ones, such as that passionate emotions are irrational, that parents socialize their children, and that nature is good and modern society corrupting.

The Venture Capital Cycle,"By Lerner, Josh and Gompers, Paul A.","The venture capital industry in the United States has grown dramatically over the last two decades. Annual inflows to venture funds have expanded from virtually zero in the mid-1970s to more than $9 billion in 1997. Many of the most visible new firms—including Apple Computer, Genentech, Intel, Lotus, Microsoft, and Yahoo—have been backed by venture capital funds. Yet despite this tremendous growth and its visible success, venture capital remains a mysterious industry. Numerous misconceptions persist about the nature and role of venture capitalists.Paul Gompers and Josh Lerner's extensive research on venture capital organizations is based largely on original data sets developed through close relationships with institutional investors in venture capital funds and investment advisors. The Venture Capital Cycle synthesizes their path-breaking work. After a historical overview, the book looks at the formation of funds, the investment of the funds in operating companies, and the liquidation of these investments. The concluding chapter provides a road map for future research in this growing area.Three themes run throughout the book. The first is that all venture capitalists confront tremendous incentive and information problems. The second is that because the various stages of the venture capital processes are related, the entire process is best viewed as a cycle. The third is that, unlike most financial markets, the venture capital industry adjusts very slowly to shifts in the supply of capital and the demand for financing."," Business & Economics , Finance",2002

Raising Unselfish Children in a Self-Absorbed World,"By Rigby, Jill","Child expert Jill Rigby reveals the dangers of the self-esteem parenting philosophy and offers an alternative approach that teaches children to respect both themselves and others.After decades of experimenting with child-focused parenting, parents are beginning to realize that the result is often self-centered children who tend toward narcissism, selfishness, mediocrity, and dysfunction. Rigby espouses a new goal of parenting: gently bumping children off self-center and teaching them to be unselfish givers instead. Raising Unselfish Children in a Self-Absorbed World dares to revisit the values of compassion, forgiveness, thanksgiving, and unselfishness and insists that we can instill these values in our children. With her encouraging approach, Rigby helps parents realize it's never too late to change their children's point of view and equip them to interact with kindness and respect in a world outside themselves. Teaching concepts, such as developing a passion for compassion, learning to give by forgiving, and filling every day with thanksgiving, Raising Unselfish Children in a Self-Absorbed World offers a new paradigm for parenting—one that educates the heart and teaches moms and dads how to parent with a new end in mind."," Religion , Christian Living , Family & Relationships",2008

In precise, subtle prose, Lord explores the reality of Red Guards and reeducation camps, of friends and families severed by political disgrace, and captures the individual voices of those caught up in them: the seven-year-old girl with a heart full of hate for her father; the journalist whose girlfriend believes the Party newspapers, not him; the imprisoned scholar who hid his writings in his quilt for years; the anti-revolutionary who tells his bitter story in a vein of high farce.

Travels with a Medieval Queen,"By Simeti, Mary Taylor","Two Women Set Out Across Europe in Search of a Dead Queen  The medieval queen in question is Constance of Hauteville, daughter of the Norman King Roger II of Sicily, wife of the Holy Roman Emperor Henry VI, and mother to the Emperor Frederick II.  In 1194, at the age of forty, Constance journeyed from Germany south to reconquer her father's throne.  On the way she discovered that she was pregnant for the first time.  She decided to give birth in public so that the world would know the child was truly hers.  These intriguing facts, and very few others, are all we know directly of Constance's life. Seventeen years ago, Mary Taylor Simeti promised in  On Persephone's Island --her now-classic memoir of an American in Sicily--that she would someday tell the story of Constance (who was, like her, an expatriate and the mother of a bicultural family).  In  Travels with a Medieval Queen , Simeti keeps her promise: retracing Constance's route from Germany to Sicily, contrasting the exotic setting of Constance's childhood in Palermo with that of her married life in the north, and drawing on reading in contiguous fields to flesh out a spare legacy of historical facts. This is the beautifully illustrated chronicle of Simeti's twentieth-century travels, first in books, then on the road, as she searches the landscapes and the monuments that survive from the twelfth century for clues to the inner life of a mother who was also a monarch."," History , Europe , Italy",2001

The Poker Bride: The First Chinese in the Wild West,"By Corbett, Christopher","When gold rush fever gripped the globe in 1849, thousands of Chinese immigrants came through San Francisco seeking fortune. InThe Poker Bride, Christopher Corbett uses a little-known Idaho legend as a lens into this Chinese experience. Before 1849, the Chinese in the United States were little more than curiosities. But as word spread of the discovery of gold, they soon became a regular sight in the American West. In San Francisco, a labyrinthine Chinatown arose where Chinese smuggled into the country were deposited. Polly, a young Chinese concubine, accompanied her owner to a mining camp in the highlands of Idaho. After he lost her in a poker game, Polly found her way with her new owner to an isolated ranch on the banks of the Salmon River. As the gold rush receded, it took with it the Chinese miners, but left behind Polly, who would make headlines when she emerged from the Idaho hills nearly half a century later to visit a modern city and tell her story. The Poker Bride vividly reconstructs a lost period of history when the first Chinese sojourners flooded into the country and left only glimmering traces of their presence scattered across the American West."," Social Science , Ethnic Studies , Asian American Studies",2010
The Language of Names: What We Call Ourselves and Why It Matters,"By Kaplan, Justin and Bernays, Anne","Why are we so often annoyed when somebody gets our name wrong? Because our sense of self is involved, and our names touch on every aspect of our lives. Prospective parents pore over baby-naming books, believing that the right choice will set their infant on the right track. Immigrants change their names to assimilate into American society; blacks to recover their African roots or to establish an Islamic identity; movie stars to conform to Hollywood images of WASP-ness, high society, or exoticism.Drawing on social and literary history, psychology and anthropology, anecdotes, and life stories, Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer Justin Kaplan and celebrated novelist Anne Bernays have created a fascinating account of names and naming in contemporary society that touches on class structure, ethnic and religious practices, manners, and everyday life. Their primary focus is the United States, which from its beginnings has been conspicuously preoccupied with identity, self-definition, and self-invention while sharing the concerns of other societies distant in time and place."," Language Arts & Disciplines , Linguistics , Semantics",1997

"Lidia's Italian-American Kitchen: The Companion to her New 52-Part Public Television Series her most Instructive, Personal, and Inspiring Cookbook","By Bastianich, Lidia Matticchio","Lidia Bastianich, loved by millions of Americans for her simple, delectable Italian cooking, gives   us her most instructive and personal cookbook yet. Focusing on the Italian-American   kitchen—the cooking she encountered when she first came to America as a young adolescent—Lidia pays homage to this “cuisine of adaptation born of necessity.” But she transforms   it subtly with her light, discriminating touch, using the authentic ingredients,   not accessible to the early immigrants, which are all so readily available today.   The aromatic flavors of fine Italian olive oil, imported Parmigiano-Reggiano and   Gorgonzola dolce latte, fresh basil, oregano, and rosemary, sun-sweetened San Marzano   tomatoes, prosciutto, and pancetta permeate the dishes she makes in her Italian-American   kitchen today. And they will transform for you this time-honored cuisine, as you   cook with Lidia, learning from her the many secret, sensuous touches that make her   food superlative.  You’ll find recipes for Scampi alla Buonavia (the garlicky shrimp   that became so popular when Lidia served the dish at her first restaurant, Buonavia),   Clams Casino (with roasted peppers and good American bacon), Caesar Salad (shaved   Parmigiano makes the difference), baked cannelloni (with roasted pork and mortadella),   and lasagna (blanketed in her special Italian-American Meat Sauce). But just as   Lidia introduced new Italian regional dishes to her appreciative clientele in Queens   in the seventies, so she dazzles us now with pasta dishes such as Bucatini with Chanterelles,   Spring Peas, and Prosciutto, and Long Fusilli with Mussels, Saffron, and Zucchini.   And she is a master at teaching us how to make our own ravioli, featherlight gnocchi,   and genuine Neapolitan pizza.

"Glenn Beck's Common Sense: The Case Against an Out-of-Control Government, Inspired by Thomas Paine","By Beck, Glenn and Kerry, Joseph (CON)","#1 New York Times bestselling author and popular radio and television host Glenn Beck revisits Thomas Paine's Common Sense.In any era, great Americans inspire us to reach our full potential. They know with conviction what they believe within themselves. They understand that all actions have consequences. And they find commonsense solutions to the nation’s problems.  One such American, Thomas Paine, was an ordinary man who changed the course of history by penning Common Sense, the concise 1776 masterpiece in which, through extraordinarily straightforward and indisputable arguments, he encouraged his fellow citizens to take control of America’s future—and, ultimately, her freedom.  Nearly two and a half centuries later, those very freedoms once again hang in the balance. And now, Glenn Beck revisits Paine’s powerful treatise with one purpose: to galvanize Americans to see past government’s easy solutions, two-party monopoly, and illogical methods and take back our great country."," Political Science , Political Freedom",2009
Philanthrocapitalism: How the Rich Can Save the World,"By Bishop, Matthew and Green, Michael F.","An examination of how today’s leading philanthropists are revolutionizing the field, using new methods to have a vastly greater impact on the world. For philanthropists of the past, charity was often a matter of simply giving money away. For the philanthrocapitalists – the new generation of billionaires who are reshaping the way they give – it’s like business. Largely trained in the corporate world, these “social investors” are using big-business-style strategies and expecting results and accountability to match. Bill Gates, the world's richest man, is leading the way: he has promised his entire fortune to finding a cure for the diseases that kill millions of children in the poorest countries in the world.  In Philanthrocapitalism, Matthew Bishop and Michael Green examine this new movement and its implications. Proceeding from interviews with some of the most powerful people on the planet—including Gates, Bill Clinton, George Soros, Angelina Jolie, and Bono, among others—they show how a web of wealthy, motivated donors has set out to change the world. Their results will have huge implications: In a climate resistant to government spending on social causes, their focused donations may be the greatest force for societal change in our world, and a source of political controversy. Combining on-the-ground anecdotes, expert analysis, and up-close profiles of the wealthy and powerful, this is a fascinating look at a small group of people who will change an enormous number of lives."," Social Science , Philanthropy & Charity",2008
"Beyond a House Divided: The Moral Consensus Ignored by Washington, Wall Street, and the Media","By Anderson, Carl","If you follow politics or the news, America is a country of culture wars and great divides, a partisan place of red states and blue states, of us against them. From pundits to politicians it seems that anyone with an audience sees a polarized country - a country at war with itself.In a radical departure from this ""conventional wisdom,"" Carl Anderson explores what the talking heads have missed: an overwhelming American consensus on many of the country's seemingly most divisive issues. If the debates are shrill in public, he says, there is a quiet consensus in private - one that America's institutions ignore at their peril. From health care, to the role of religion in America, to abortion, to the importance of traditional ethics in business and society, Anderson uses fresh polling data and keen insight in BEYOND A HOUSE DIVIDED to show that a surprising consensus has emerged despite these debates. He sheds light on what's been missing in the public and political debates of the last several years: the consensus that isn't hard to find if you know where to look.For Anderson, allowing polar opposites to drive the discussion has made the resolution of contentious issues impossible. Instead, he says, we should look to the consensus among Americans as the best prospect for a beneficial conclusion."," Political Science , Essays",2010

Anyone Can Grow Up: How George Bush and I Made It to the White House,"By Carlson, Margaret","Margaret Carlson -- widely read Time columnist, regular CNN panelist, political insider, and hostess of A-list but scarcely traditional Washington dinners -- has been commenting on American life for over a decade. In Anyone Can Grow Up, she expands on her writings about presidents, politics, morals, children, family life, and lessons from her own life.  In the section entitled ""Presidential Material,"" Carlson reflects on what it takes to be president by looking at those who choose to pursue the office (and by extension, those, like her, who choose to cover the pursuit). She looks at the hard facts (offices held, speeches given, money raised) and the soft, sometimes determinative, ones (how the candidates talk and look, how they perform under pressure, who they marry and divorce when no one is looking, and how they get into -- and out of  -- scrapes). The best man doesn't always win. That's why those who've lost, and those who almost run but don't, are covered as well. Bush Sr. and son, and Clinton in his scandalous term, are here. Carlson also takes a look at those whom have thought of running, like Donald Trump, those who America wanted to run, like Colin Powell, and those who've run and lost, like John McCain.  Carlson draws from her own life in the ""Family Matters"" section as well, commenting on subjects relating to children, women, and men -- from abortion to balancing work and family, from feminism to sexual harassment.  Finally, in the last section, we read about what makes us who we are and what makes us do what we do. From breaking down how congressmen make money on the side to what cost Newt Gingrich his job, from days in court trying the Menendez brothers to a memorable three-hour lunch with Katharine Hepburn that didn't turn out the way she imagined, Carlson finds the strength of character, or lack of it, in Americans famous and not.  Carlson gets as many as a hundred letters a week from readers who say, ""That's exactly what I was thinking."" In the vein of Anna Quindlen, Ellen Goodman, and Bill O'Reilly, here is a wise and witty book from a writer who knows what makes us tick."," Political Science , General",2003

31 Days: The Crisis That Gave Us the Government We Have Today,"By Werth, Barry","In 31 Days, Barry Werth takes readers inside the White House during the tumultuous days following Nixon’s resignation and the swearing-in of America’s “accidental president,” Gerald Ford. The congressional hearings, Nixon’s increasing paranoia, and, finally, the devastating revelations of the White House tapes had torn the country apart. Within the White House and the Republican Party, Nixon’s resignation produced new fissures and battle lines—and new opportunities for political advancement.Ford had to reassure the nation and the world that he would attend to the pressing issues of the day, from resolving the legal questions surrounding Nixon’s role in Watergate, to dealing with the wind down of the Vietnam War, the precarious state of détente with the Soviet Union, and the ongoing attempts to stabilize the Middle East. Within hours of Nixon’s departure from Washington, Ford began the all-important task of forming an inner circle of trusted advisers.In richly detailed scenes, Werth describes the often vicious sparring among two mutually distrustful staffs—Nixon’s and Ford’s vice presidential holdovers—and a transition team that included Donald Rumsfeld (then Nixon’s ambassador to NATO) and Rumsfeld’s former deputy, the thirty-three-year-old coolly efficient Richard Cheney. The first detailed account of the ruthless maneuvering and day-to-day politicking behind everything from the pardon of Nixon to why George H. W. Bush was passed over for the vice presidency, to the rise of a new cadre of Republican movers and shakers, 31 Days offers a compelling perspective on a fascinating but relatively unexamined period in American history and its impact on the present."," Political Science , American Government , Executive Branch",2006

Line drawings and charts help us to understand the construction and rigging of the great ships, the types and disposition of the guns, and how they were operated in battle. A number of contemporary drawings and cartoons illustrate aspects of naval life from the press gang to the scullery. Finally, a generous selection of full-color paintings render the majesty and the excitement of fleet actions in the age of fighting sail."," History , Military , Naval",1995

"John Kenneth Galbraith: His Life, His Politics, His Economics","By Parker, Richard","The life and times of America’s most celebrated economist, assessing his lessons—and warnings—for us todayJohn Kenneth Galbraith’s books—among them The Affluent Society and American Capitalism—are famous for good reason. Written by a scholar renowned for energetic political engagement and irrepressible wit, they are models of provocative good sense that warn prophetically of the dangers of deregulated markets, war in Asia, corporate greed, and stock-market bubbles. Galbraith’s work has also deeply—and controversially—influenced his own profession, and in Richard Parker’s hands his biography becomes a vital reinterpretation of American economics and public policy.Born and raised on a small Canadian farm, Galbraith began teaching at Harvard during the Depression. He was FDR’s “price czar” during the war and then a senior editor of Fortune before returning to Harvard and to fame as a bestselling writer. Parker shows how, from his early championing of Keynes to his acerbic analysis of America’s “private wealth and public squalor,” Galbraith regularly challenged prevailing theories and policies. And his account of Galbraith’s remarkable friendship with John F. Kennedy, whom he served as a close advisor while ambassador to India, is especially relevant for its analysis of the intense, dynamic debates that economists and politicians can have over how America should manage its wealth and power. This masterful chronicle gives color, depth, and meaning to the record of an extraordinary life.                                                                               Richard Parker is an Oxford-trained economist and senior fellow of the Shorenstein Center at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. A cofounder of the magazine Mother Jones, he writes extensively on economics and public policy. He lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with his wife and children.                                                     A New York Times Notable Book John Kenneth Galbraith is America's most famous economist for good reason. A witty commentator on America's political follies and a versatile author of bestselling books that warn prophetically of the dangers of deregulated markets, corporate greed, and inattention to the costs of our military power (among them The Great Crash: 1929, The Affluent Society, and The New Industrial State), Galbraith always makes economics relevant to the crises of the day. This first authorized biography is, in Richard Parker's hands, an important reinterpretation both of public policy and of how economics is practiced. Born in 1908 and raised on a small Canadian farm, Galbraith began to teach at Harvard in his twenties. In 1938 he left to work in New Deal Washington, eventually rising to become FDR's ""price czar"" during the war. Following his years as a writer at Fortune, where he did much to introduce the work of John Maynard Keynes to a wide audience, he returned to Harvard in 1949 and began writing the books that would make him famous. Over the years, Galbraith developed a distinctive way of ""doing economics,"" and it made him a critic both of conservatives and of many liberal economists. Parker's vibrant, nuanced portrait is enlightening on Galbraith's engagement with his fellow economists and the politics they influenced?from the ""Neoclassical Synthesis"" and the New Frontier to monetarism, supply-siders, and the conservative revolution of the 1980s and 1990s. It is also a dramatic narrative about public policies and the people who create them, for Galbraith was often at the very epicenter of politics in his time. From his acerbic analysis of the nation's ""private wealth and public squalor"" in the 1950s to his denunciations of the Vietnam War, Galbraith regularly challenged the ""conventional wisdom"" (a phrase he coined). Parker's account of Galbraith's friendship with John F. Kennedy, whom he served as ambassador to India, is filled with new insights and information about economic policy, about American policy in Asia, and about the heavy influence of the Pentagon's budget on every aspect of public affairs. Subsequent chapters, analyzing Galbraith's responses to the mistakes made by later administrations in managing America's wealth and power, offer a powerful critique of the Johnson, Nixon, Reagan, and Clinton years. But Parker gives equal attention to the warm, lively, and nourishing friendships that shaped the private life of Kenneth and Kitty Galbraith and their high-spirited family. This masterful chronicle gives color, depth, and meaning to the record of an extraordinary life.                  ""There was a time when John Kenneth Galbraith was the most famous economist in America, a man whose books regularly became best sellers. But today he is little honored in the economics profession, where, as Richard Parker remarks in his engaging and exhaustive biography, Mr. Galbraith is regarded as something of an outsider, a fine writer who never became comfortable with the detailed mathematical formulas that came to dominate economics.""?Floyd Norris, The New York Times                               ""There was a time when John Kenneth Galbraith was the most famous economist in America, a man whose books regularly became best sellers. But today he is little honored in the economics profession, where, as Richard Parker remarks in his engaging and exhaustive biography, Mr. Galbraith is regarded as something of an outsider, a fine writer who never became comfortable with the detailed mathematical formulas that came to dominate economics.""?Floyd Norris, The New York Times ""Parker's book is both a biography and a treatise on the misinterpretations and disastrous mistakes?the mystery of stagflation, the bubble of the 90's, Vietnam?that theoretical rigidity and deference to experts have brought over the last hundred years. It is also, thanks to Galbraith's longevity, his work in so many administrations, and his battles with so many other economic thinkers, a fine one-volume history of economic thought in the 20th century . . . I will confess that I was initially skeptical about the book's 820 pages of dense type, but every detail is justified and every digression fascinating . . . [A] comprehensive account of the 20th century's economic battles.""?Thomas Frank, The New York Times Book Review ""[Parker is] an engaging writer [who] does a good job covering all [the] episodes in [Galbraith's] busy life. At every point he is at pains to set the stage, making sure that the reader understands the characters and motives involved and the issues at stake.""?Dan Seligman, The Wall Street Journal ""With a strong grasp of complex economic issues that span some sixty years, Parker succeeds in placing Galbraith's economic contributions within the intellectual tradition?part Keynesian and part derived from the work of Thorstein Veblen?to which they belong . . . In tracing Galbraith's intellectual development, Parker has also written a much-needed history of American progressivism.""?Jeffrey Madrick, The New York Review of Books ""Doing justice to this life story requires an outsize biography, one that not only tells Mr. Galbraith's tale but sets it on the broader canvas of America's political and economic evolution. And Richard Parker's book does just that . . . He is a good writer, who is particularly deft at bringing to life and explaining economic ideas and policy debates.""?The Economist ""The story of this man's life and work, wonderfully rendered in this magnum opus, offers an antidote to the public ennui, economic cruelty, and government malfeasance that poison life in America today . . . Parker lifts up a single life as an image of how intelligence, compassion, and commitment remain the essence of social hope.""?James Carroll, The Boston Globe ""John Kenneth Galbraith towered?literally and figuratively?over twentieth-century America, afflicting the comfortable with searing wit and unassailable logic, and comforting the afflicted with compelling ideas for improving society to the benefit of all. To understand the ideals that propelled America from FDR's New Deal until Bush's Raw Deal, one must comprehend Galbraith's life, politics, and economics. Herewith, a stunningly lucid guide. Richard Parker gives to Galbraith the deep insight and sweeping perspective that Galbraith gives to America.""?Robert B. Reich, Brandeis University ""Parker's timely biography of Ken Galbraith and his brilliant career is an extraordinary gift to a nation grappling more than ever with the profound issues that Galbraith addressed so eloquently over so many years with his famed intellect and wit. Galbraith's passion for social justice, his skepticism about excessive power in the hands of either government or the private sector, and his indispensable contributions to progressive politics and economic thought shine through every page of this book, and they are still highly relevant to our twenty-first-century national debate on the great domestic and global challenges of our time. For all who care about a better world and a fairer reconciliation at home and abroad between what Galbraith called 'private affluence and public squalor,' this remarkable volume should be required reading. It is both an education and an inspiration.""?Senator Edward M. Kennedy ""This is a superb book, literate and fascinating, about one of the truly original minds of the century. No one can write about contemporary economics, politics, diplomacy, wit, satire and phrase-making without taking John Kenneth Galbraith into just account, and Richard Parker is the ideal biographer.""?Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. ""In its breadth of interest, its erudition, its ease in explaining economics in everyday language, and, above all, in its skillful, first-rate story-telling, Richard Parker's splendid, immensely readable biography is in every way a match for the towering and fascinating figure who strides through its pages.""?Adam Hochschild ""John Kenneth Galbraith has been, against the tide, a shameless advocate for a government that would guarantee all of us a decent existence. This saga of his life and thought presents a lively review of what has happened to our economy and to the profession of economics in the last seventy years.""?Barbara Bergmann, author of The Economic Emergence of Women ""John Kenneth Galbraith is the Harvard economist who became one of the most influential oracles of the contemporary world. An often searing critic of big business, he has been responsible for reshaping the anatomy of modern thought, extending his lively sanctions into the many branches of his eclectic intellect. In this thoughtful and highly readable volume, the Oxford-trained economist Richard Parker provides an essential guide to the man and his ideas. It captures an extraordinary life, extraordinarily well.""?Peter C. Newman ""Parker has written an engrossing, thoroughly researched, and authoritative account of the life of John Kenneth Galbraith. The book not only details the richly varied experiences of one of the great public intellectuals and social commentators of our time; it also offers a most interesting account of the evolution of economic thought from the era of John Maynard Keynes to the present day.""?Derek Bok ""An engaging and comprehensive review of the life and times of a brilliant, prolific twentieth-century thinker. Galbraith understands that the structural determinants, limitations, and consequences of markets have been largely ignored by economists?to the detriment of the discipline and of society. This is a poignant book with important messages for the twenty-first century.""?David K. Foot, University of Toronto and co-author of Boom, Bust & Echo ""[An] accessible, well-written approach to both Galbraith's life and the larger issues to which he has so effectively devoted his thought: an exemplary intellectual biography.""?Kirkus Reviews (starred review) ""[Galbraith] took on academic and political orthodoxies to transform the way informed people think about the economy, institutions, and social justice . . .

Divided America: The Ferocious Power Struggle in American Politics,"By Black, Earl and Black, Merle","Divided America tells the biggest story in American politics today. It's the story behind the emergence of a ferocious power struggle between conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats that is tearing the country's politics apart.Drawing on extensive polling data and close analyses of presidential, senatorial, and congressional elections over the past fifty years, two eminent political scientists show, for the first time, how partisan warfare has reduced both major parties to minority status and locked them into fierce power struggles in each election cycle, thereby making America less stable and more difficult to govern.Because the two major parties are now evenly balanced in the national electorate, control of the White House and Congress can shift dramatically with each election. Neither Republicans nor Democrats operate with any ""lock"" on the presidency, House of Representatives, or Senate, as demonstrated by the 2006 congressional elections. Earl Black and Merle Black examine the party battles as they've played themselves out in the nation's five principal geographic areas. Each party has developed two important regional strongholds, as exemplified in the 2004 elections, when Republicans won all the electoral votes and sizable majorities of House and Senate seats in the South and Mountain/Plains states while the Democrats won almost all the electoral votes and large majorities in the Northeast and the Pacific Rim states. The Midwest is the perennial swing region.The authors describe the enormous changes that have occurred in the electorates of each region over the past fifty years -- with emphasis on how the size and partisan affiliations of key groups have changed -- and show how these transformations have generated today's unstable two-party battles. Although the relentlessly competitive nature of modern American politics is generally appreciated, the regional causes underlying this new state of affairs are not well understood. Because neither Democrats nor Republicans can produce national majorities simply by sweeping their regional strongholds, they are locked in a fierce power struggle in each election. Divided America tells the story of these remarkable developments in clear, vigorous prose and provides a pragmatic understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each party.For the foreseeable future, each party will be within striking distance of winning -- or losing -- political power in every national institution. Understanding the party battles in America's regions is vital to understanding how today's losers can become tomorrow's winners"," Political Science , Political Process , Political Parties",2007

Lost in the Forest: A Novel (Ballantine Reader's Circle),"By Miller, Sue","For nearly two decades, since the publication of her iconic first novel, The Good Mother, Sue Miller has distinguished herself as one of our most elegant and widely celebrated chroniclers of family life, with a singular gift for laying bare the interior lives of her characters. In each of her novels, Miller has written with exquisite precision about the experience of grace in daily life–the sudden, epiphanic recognition of the extraordinary amid the ordinary–as well as the sharp and unexpected motions of the human heart away from it, toward an unruly netherworld of upheaval and desire. But never before have Miller’s powers been keener or more transfixing than they are in Lost in the Forest, a novel set in the vineyards of Northern California that tells the story of a young girl who, in the wake of a tragic accident, seeks solace in a damaging love affair with a much older man.Eva, a divorced and happily remarried mother of three, runs a small bookstore in a town north of San Francisco. When her second husband, John, is killed in a car accident, her family’s fragile peace is once again overtaken by loss. Emily, the eldest, must grapple with newfound independence and responsibility. Theo, the youngest, can only begin to fathom his father’s death. But for Daisy, the middle child, John’s absence opens up a world of bewilderment, exposing her at the onset of adolescence to the chaos and instability that hover just beyond the safety of parental love. In her sorrow, Daisy embarks on a harrowing sexual odyssey, a journey that will cast her even farther out onto the harsh promontory of adulthood and lost hope.With astonishing sensuality and immediacy, Lost in the Forest moves through the most intimate realms of domestic life, from grief and sex to adolescence and marriage. It is a stunning, kaleidoscopic evocation of a family in crisis, written with delicacy and masterful care. For her lifelong fans and those just discovering Sue Miller for the first time, here is a rich and gorgeously layered tale of a family breaking apart and coming back together again: Sue Miller at her inimitable best.From the Hardcover edition."," Fiction , Sagas",2006

A Civil War: Army vs. Navy: A Year Inside College Football's Purest Rivalry,"By Feinstein, John","A Civil War is bestselling sportswriter John Feinstein's account of one extraordinary year in Army and Navy football, the breathtaking 1995 campaign. Feinstein followed both teams through the year, attending their practices and classes, relaxing with them in their limited free time, standing with them on the sideline at their games. For Navy, it was a must-win year. The Cadets had beaten the Midshipmen three years straight, each time in heartbreaking fashion, and for the entire senior class the Army game would be a last chance for redemption. Army had its own troubles: a beloved coach was in danger of losing his job and the team leaders were determined to finish their careers with a winning season and a bowl game invitation. A Civil War traces the ups and downs of both teams through the season, showing how these remarkable young men dealt with the rigors of football along with the constant pressure of academy life, while re-creating the intense weeks leading up to the showdown. The account here of the 1995 Army-Navy game is an unforgettable piece of sportswriting, an up-close retelling of a heart-stopping game from both sides of the field."," Sports & Recreation , Football",1996

Get  the lowdown on who's low and how's down, whose long-standing but unspoken conflict with her mother is contributing to her sexual repression, and whose boyfriend named his penis. A hysterical send-up of everyday life and love with lots of heart,  Lipshtick is a quick fix, a good schmooze, a heartfelt sob or two.It will take you on a trip through things universal to all pairs of X chromosomes worth their salt: for coping with social dances in junior high (where the sexes meet like a hormonal high noon) to the joys of plucking out your chin hair like evil weeds; from the natural order of a girl's fantasies (like sweets that don't make you fat, spending that doesn't break the bank, a beautiful nap in the middle of a long day) to why flings with bad boys are the ultimate in dating pleasure (finding the right boy to lust after is a lifelong  struggle--eventually you grow to be picky about who rejects you); from getting married (His best quality? He was like family. His worst quality? He was like family.) to the sad state of postnatal breasts. Gwen Macsai cover it all--with a shtick twist. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll thank God you're not her. No situation unaccounted for, no mole left unexamined, Macsai captures a woman's life from her first leg-shave to her last dose of hormone replacement therapy. When you finish  Lipshtick you'll have added another great girlfriend to your already glittering array. And in this world you can't have enough girlfriends or laughter."," Humor , Form , Essays",2000

Activate: An Entirely New Approach to Small Groups,"By Searcy, Nelson and Thomas, Kerrick","Church leaders want to know how to make small groups work for their church communities, yet a quick look around shows that while small groups are all the rage, much of the time they create more problems than they solve.

Drawing from the startling success of small groups at The Journey Church (which has had over 100-percent participation in small groups for more than 4 years) Searcy and Thomas show how church leaders can implement a life-changing small-group ministry that gets the maximum number of people involved and solves many of the important (yet irritating) problems facing churches of all sizes."," Religion , Christian Church , Growth",2008

The Devil Amongst the Lawyers: A Ballad Novel (Ballad Novels),"By McCrumb, Sharyn","In 1935, when Erma Morton, a beautiful young woman with a teaching degree, is charged with the murder of her father in a remote Virginia mountain community, the case becomes a cause célèbre for the national press. Eager for a case to replace the Lindbergh trial in the public’s imagination, the journalists descend on the mountain county intent on infusing their stories with quaint local color: horse-drawn buggies, rundown shacks, children in threadbare clothes. They need tales of rural poverty to give their Depression-era readers people whom they can feel superior to. The untruth of these cultural stereotypes did not deter the big-city reporters, but a local journalist, Carl Jennings, fresh out of college and covering his first major story, reports what he sees: an ordinary town and a defendant who is probably guilty. This journey to a distant time and place summons up ghosts from the reporters’ pasts:  Henry Jernigan’s sojourn in Japan that ended in tragedy, Shade Baker’s hardscrabble childhood on the Iowa prairie, and Rose Hanelon’s brittle sophistication, a shield for her hopeless love affair. While they spin their manufactured tales of squalor, Carl tries to discover the truth in the Morton trial with the help of his young cousin Nora, who has the Sight. But who will believe a local cub reporter whose stories contradict the nation’s star journalists? For the reader, the novel resonates with the present: an economic depression, a deadly flu epidemic, a world contending with the rise of political fanatics, and a media culture determined to turn news stories into soap operas for the diversion of the masses.A stunning return to the lands, ballads, and characters upon which she made her name, The Devil Amongst the Lawyers is a testament to Sharyn McCrumb’s lyrical and evocative writing."," Fiction , Mystery & Detective , Historical",2010

To the exotic Aminpour sisters, Ireland looks like a much-needed safe haven. It has been seven years since Marjan Aminpour fled Iran with her younger sisters, Bahar and Layla, and she hopes that in Ballinacroagh, a land of “crazed sheep and dizzying roads,” they might finally find a home.From the kitchen of an old pastry shop on Main Mall, the sisters set about creating a Persian oasis. Soon sensuous wafts of cardamom, cinnamon, and saffron float through the streets–an exotic aroma that announces the opening of the Babylon Café, and a shock to a town that generally subsists on boiled cabbage and Guinness served at the local tavern. And it is an affront to the senses of Ballinacroagh’s uncrowned king, Thomas McGuire. After trying to buy the old pastry shop for years and failing, Thomas is enraged to find it occupied–and by foreigners, no less. But the mysterious, spicy fragrances work their magic on the townsfolk, and soon, business is booming. Marjan is thrilled with the demand for her red lentil soup, abgusht stew, and rosewater baklava–and with the transformation in her sisters. Young Layla finds first love, and even tense, haunted Bahar seems to be less nervous. And in the stand-up-comedian-turned-priest Father Fergal Mahoney, the gentle, lonely widow Estelle Delmonico, and the headstrong hairdresser Fiona Athey, the sisters find a merry band of supporters against the close-minded opposition of less welcoming villagers stuck in their ways. But the idyll is soon broken when the past rushes back to threaten the Amnipours once more, and the lives they left behind in revolution-era Iran bleed into the present.  Infused with the textures and scents, trials and triumph,s of two distinct cultures, Pomegranate Soup is an infectious novel of magical realism. This richly detailed story, highlighted with delicious recipes, is a delectable journey into the heart of Persian cooking and Irish living."," Fiction , Humorous , General",2006

"Judgment Days: Lyndon Baines Johnson, Martin Luther King Jr., And The Laws That Changed America","By Kotz, Nick","Opposites in almost every way, mortally suspicious of each other at first, Lyndon Baines Johnson and Martin Luther King, Jr., were thrust together in the aftermath of John F. Kennedy's assassination. Both men sensed a historic opportunity and began a delicate dance of accommodation that moved them, and the entire nation, toward the historic Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Drawing on a wealth of newly available sources -- Johnson's taped telephone conversations, voluminous FBI wiretap logs, previously secret communications between the FBI and the president -- Nick Kotz gives us a dramatic narrative, rich in dialogue, that presents this momentous period with thrilling immediacy. Judgment Days offers needed perspective on a presidency too often linked solely to the tragedy of Vietnam.We watch Johnson applying the arm-twisting tactics that made him a legend in the Senate, and we follow King as he keeps the pressure on in the South through protest and passive resistance. King's pragmatism and strategic leadership and Johnson's deeply held commitment to a just society shaped the character of their alliance. Kotz traces the inexorable convergence of their paths to an intense joint effort that made civil rights a legislative reality at last, despite FBI director J. Edgar Hoover's vicious whispering campaign to destroy King.Judgment Days also reveals how this spirit of teamwork disintegrated. The two leaders parted bitterly over King's opposition to the Vietnam War. In this first full account of the working relationship between Johnson and King, Kotz offers a detailed, surprising account that significantly enriches our understanding of both men and their time."," Political Science , Civil Rights",2005

Dieters can actually lose weight by eating foods, nutrients, teas, and spices that change the chemical balance of the brain for permanent weight loss—a major factor contributing to how quickly the body ages.

Terrorism and America: A Commonsense Strategy for a Democratic Society (BCSIA Studies in International Security),"By Heymann, Philip B.","An evenhanded look at how democracies can fight terrorism while maintaining a healthy society.The bombings of the World Trade Center and the Oklahoma City federal building have shown that terrorist attacks can happen anywhere in the United States. Around the globe, massacres, hijackings, and bombings of airliners are frequent reminders of the threat of terrorism. The use of poison gas in the Tokyo subway has raised the specter of even more horrible forms of terror -- including the use of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. In this book, Philip Heymann argues that the United States and other democracies can fight terrorism while preserving liberty and maintaining a healthy, unified society. Drawing on his experience in the US Departments of State and Justice, he shows how domestic and foreign intelligence-gathering can thwart terrorism, how the United States must cooperate and share information with its allies, and how terrorism can be prevented in many cases. Terrorism will never disappear completely, but the policies Heymann offers can limit the harm to Americans and protect the integrity of US governmental processes."," Political Science , Security (National & International)",2000

"The Great Derangement: A Terrifying True Story of War, Politics, and Religion","By Taibbi, Matt","A REVELATORY AND DARKLY COMIC ADVENTURE THROUGH A NATION ON THE VERGE OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN—FROM THE HALLS OF CONGRESS TO THE BASES OF BAGHDAD TO THE APOCALYPTIC CHURCHES OF THE HEARTLANDRolling Stone’s Matt Taibbi set out to describe the nature of George Bush’s America in the post-9/11 era and ended up vomiting demons in an evangelical church in Texas, riding the streets of Baghdad in an American convoy to nowhere, searching for phantom fighter jets in Congress, and falling into the rabbit hole of the 9/11 Truth Movement.Matt discovered in his travels across the country that the resilient blue state/red state narrative of American politics had become irrelevant. A large and growing chunk of the American population was so turned off—or radicalized—by electoral chicanery, a spineless news media, and the increasingly blatant lies from our leaders (“they hate us for our freedom”) that they abandoned the political mainstream altogether. They joined what he calls The Great Derangement.Taibbi tells the story of this new American madness by inserting himself into four defining American subcultures: The Military, where he finds himself mired in the grotesque black comedy of the American occupation of Iraq; The System, where he follows the money-slicked path of legislation in Congress; The Resistance, where he doubles as chief public antagonist and undercover member of the passionately bonkers 9/11 Truth Movement; and The Church, where he infiltrates a politically influential apocalyptic mega-ministry in Texas and enters the lives of its desperate congregants. Together these four interwoven adventures paint a portrait of a nation dangerously out of touch with reality and desperately searching for answers in all the wrong places.Funny, smart, and a little bit heartbreaking, The Great Derangement is an audaciously reported, sobering, and illuminating portrait of America at the end of the Bush era."," Political Science , Commentary & Opinion",2009

Even Silence Has an End: My Six Years of Captivity in the Colombian Jungle,"By Betancourt, Ingrid","Ingrid Betancourt tells the story of her captivity in the Colombian jungle, sharing powerful teachings of resilience, resistance, and faith.   Born in Bogotá, raised in France, Ingrid Betancourt at the age of thirty-two gave up a life of comfort and safety to return to Colombia to become a political leader in a country that was being slowly destroyed by terrorism, violence, fear, and a pervasive sense of hopelessness. In 2002, while campaigning as a candidate in the Colombian presidential elections, she was abducted by the FARC. Nothing could have prepared her for what came next. She would spend the next six and a half years in the depths of the jungle as a prisoner of the FARC. Even Silence Has an End is her deeply personal and moving account of that time. Chained day and night for much of her captivity, she never stopped dreaming of escape and, in fact, succeeded in getting away several times, always to be recaptured. In her most successful effort she and a fellow captive survived a week away, but were caught when her companion became desperately ill; she learned later that they had been mere miles from freedom.  The facts of her story are astounding, but it is Betancourt's indomitable spirit that drives this very special account, bringing life, nuance, and profundity to the narrative. Attending as intimately to the landscape of her mind as she does to the events of her capture and captivity, Even Silence Has an End is a meditation on the very stuff of life-fear and freedom, hope and what inspires it. Betancourt tracks her metamorphosis, sharing how in the routines she established for herself-listening to her mother and two children broadcast to her over the radio, daily prayer-she was able to do the unthinkable: to move through the pain of the moment and find a place of serenity.  Freed in 2008 by the Colombian army, today Betancourt is determined to draw attention to the plight of hostages and victims of terrorism throughout the world and it is that passion that motivates Even Silence Has an End. The lessons she offers here-in courage, resilience, and humanity-are gifts to treasure."," Political Science , Political Ideologies , Communism, Post-Communism & Socialism",2010

Information Architecture for the World Wide Web: Designing Large-scale Web Sites,"By Morville, Peter and Rosenfeld, Louis","Some web sites ""work"" and some don't.  Good web site consultants know that you can't just jump in and start writing HTML, the same way you can't build a house by just pouring a foundation and putting up some walls.  You need to know who will be using the site, and what they'll be using it for.  You need some idea of what you'd like to draw their attention to during their visit. Overall, you need a strong, cohesive vision for the site that makes it both distinctive and usable.Information Architecture for the World Wide Web is about applying the principles of architecture and library science to web site design.  Each web site is like a public building, available for tourists and regulars alike to breeze through at their leisure. The job of the architect is to set up the framework for the site to make it comfortable and inviting for people to visit, relax in, and perhaps even return to someday.Most books on web development concentrate either on the aesthetics or the mechanics of the site.  This book is about the framework that holds the two together.  With this book, you learn how to design web sites and intranets that support growth, management, and ease of use.  Special attention is given to:The process behind architecting a large, complex siteWeb site hierarchy design and organizationInformation Architecture for the World Wide Web is for webmasters, designers, and anyone else involved in building a web site.

"Gods of War, Gods of Peace: How the Meeting of Native and Colonial Religions Shaped Early America","By Bourne, Russell","Through dramatic comparisons of Native American and early colonial politics, history, and religion, historian Russell Bourne offers a complete and insightful look at how these two disparate groups influenced each other and how this interchange helped forge the basis for the culture we live in today. Despite living in a war-torn world, both sides made heroic efforts to reach out to each other. The religious and cultural concepts of the Native Americans helped to transform the colonists, turning many into pantheists, communal villagers, and woodland warriors. Similarly, many of the Native Americans became evangelical Christians, farmers, traders, and even commanders of nationalistic armies. Benjamin Franklin, marveling at the cooperation and mutual respect evident among the Six Nations of the Iroquois, suggested that colonial leaders should follow their lead. Yet, in the end, differences and treacheries drove the two peoples apart. Based on extensive historical research and consultation with numerous Native American and academic sources, Gods of War, Gods of Peace offers a revelatory new view of how Native American and colonial religions shaped America and its ideals."," History , Native American",2002

Easy-to-Make Decorative Kites: Step-by-Step Instructions for Nine Models from Around the World,"By Bridgewater, Alan and Bridgewater, Gill","Flying a beautiful kite is exhilarating and all the more thrilling and rewarding when the kite soaring in the sunshine is your own creation!This exciting practical guide helps even new kite makers to experience the adventure of constructing and flying nine original kites based on traditional designs from around the world. Step-by-step instructions and detailed diagrams take you through the process of assembling, testing, decorating, and flying each of the kites. Finished kites must be aerodynamically sound, but the authors allow plenty of leeway in construction: ""In kite making, precise measurements are less important than balance, proportion, and symmetry."" And although materials are specified for each design, the easy-to-follow directions allow for a variety of lightweight, durable substitutions.Beginners and children will want to start with the simple, universally familiar European Diamond Kite. But neither the intricate, unusually shaped Oriental kite nor the scientifically sophisticated, efficient High-Tech Box Kite is very hard to make. The spectacular Guatemalan Sun Kite is a high flier that sings as it soars, the result of four easy-to-make ""buzzers"" that vibrate in the wind. Designed to be flown at night and illuminated with flashlights, the intriguing New England Ghost Kite is an excellent ""swooper."" Each design has a unique flying style: the Chinese Yuan flies well in a light-to-moderate wind while the High-Tech Box requires a good stiff breeze; the Chinese Dragonfly and Oriental Butterfly are low, steady fliers, and the Guatemalan Sun and Korean Warrior are showy high fliers. All are magnificent examples of a 2,000-year history of kite flying."," Design , Decorative Arts",1986
"Hello, My Name Is Mommy: The Dysfunctional Girl's Guide to Having, Loving (and Hopefully Not Screwing Up) a Baby","By Lynch, Sheri","Hilarious and true and inspirational, Hello, My Name is Mommy is for every pregnant woman and new mother who ever felt helpless and out of control instead of confident and aglow.Sure, women know pregnancy is no bed of roses, but Lynch taps into her own dysfunctional childhood and fears about becoming a mom to label a much profounder worry many moms-to-be have: that their own pasts were so screwed up that they're doomed to repeat the cycle. Dr. Spock may tell moms to trust their instincts, but Lynch's Misfit Mommies want to do every last thing but that. They feel like frauds and imposters, and Lynch's real-girl's voice will be instantly recognizable to them. Lynch will walk and talk new moms through it all: from lamenting the hot dogs and second-hand smoke they were raised on (and, of course, ""you turned out just fine"") to the realization that kids are kind of germy and gross (but feeling that way doesn't make one a bad mother) to keeping it together at work with Cheerios in the old nursing bra."," Young Adult Nonfiction , Social Topics , Pregnancy",2004

Java in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference for Java Programmers (In a Nutshell (O'Reilly)),"By Flanagan, David","The bestselling Java in a Nutshell has been updated to cover Java 1.1.   If you're a Java programmer who is migrating to 1.1, this second  edition contains everything you need to get up to speed on the new features of Java 1.1.  Or if you are just now jumping on the Java bandwagon, Java in a Nutshell still has all of the features that have  made it the Java book most often recommended on the Internet.  An  advanced introduction to Java for C and C++ programmers teaches you  everything you need to know about the language, while the complete  quick-reference contains descriptions of all of the classes in the  Java 1.1 API, with the exception of the Enterprise APIs.Java in a Nutshell also fully describes the syntax of the Java language,  making it the only quick reference that a Java programmer needs.The second edition of Java in a Nutshell covers Version 1.1 of the Java  Development Kit (JDK).  It includes all of the material from the first  edition, as well as the following updated information for Java 1.1:A detailed overview of all of the features in Java 1.1, both on a package-by-package basis and in terms of overall functionality.A comprehensive tutorial on ""inner classes"" that explains how to use all of the new types of inner classes: static member classes, member classes, local classes, and anonymous classes.Practical, real-world example programs that demonstrate the  features in Java 1.1, including object serialization, the new AWT event handling model, internationalization, and a sample Java Bean.A complete quick reference for all of the classes, methods, and variables in the core Java 1.1 API.

This volume, the ""original"" Java in a Nutshell, documents the most commonly used features of Java and is an indispensable reference for all Java programmers.  We may publish a separate volume that will cover the Java ""Enterprise APIs"", which include the database connectivity, remote method invocation, and security features, as well as other forthcoming components, such as CORBA IDL support and the electronic commerce framework.  And as other new Java APIs are developed and released, we may consider adding new volumes to the Java in a Nutshell series."," Computers , Programming Languages , Java",1997

"An Affair of State: The Investigation, Impeachment, and Trial of President Clinton","By Posner, Richard A.","President Bill Clinton's year of crisis, which began when his affair with Monica Lewinsky hit the front pages in January 1998, engendered a host of important questions of criminal and constitutional law, public and private morality, and political and cultural conflict. In a book written while the events of the year were unfolding, Richard Posner presents a balanced and scholarly understanding of the crisis that also has the freshness and immediacy of journalism. Posner clarifies the issues and eliminates misunderstandings concerning facts and the law that were relevant to the investigation by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and to the impeachment proceeding itself. He explains the legal definitions of obstruction of justice and perjury, which even many lawyers are unfamiliar with. He carefully assesses the conduct of Starr and his prosecutors, including their contacts with the lawyers for Paula Jones and their hardball tactics with Monica Lewinsky and her mother. He compares and contrasts the Clinton affair with Watergate, Iran-Contra, and the impeachment of Andrew Johnson, exploring the subtle relationship between public and private morality. And he examines the place of impeachment in the American constitutional scheme, the pros and cons of impeaching President Clinton, and the major procedural issues raised by both the impeachment in the House and the trial in the Senate. This book, reflecting the breadth of Posner's experience and expertise, will be the essential foundation for anyone who wants to understand President Clinton's impeachment ordeal."," Law , Constitutional",1999

Ordinary Resurrections,"By Kozol, Jonathan","In a stirring departure from his earlier work, Jonathan Kozol has written his most personal and hopeful book to date, an energized and unexpected answer to the bleakness of Death at an Early Age, the classic that he published more than 30 years ago.Like his most recent book, Amazing Grace, this work also takes place in New York's South Bronx; but it is a markedly different book in mood and vantage point, because we see life this time through the eyes of children, not, as the author puts it, from the perspective of a grown-up man encumbered with a Harvard education. Here, too, we see devoted teachers in a good but underfunded public elementary school that manages, against all odds, to be a warm, inviting, and protective place; and we see the children also in the intimate religious setting of a church in which they are watched over by the vigilant grandmothers of the neighborhood and by a priest whose ministry is, first and foremost, to the very young.A work of guarded optimism that avoids polemic and the fevered ideologies of partisan debate, Ordinary Resurrections is a book about the little miracles of stubbornly persistent innocence in children who are still unsoiled by the world and still can view their place within it without cynicism or despair.The author's personal involvement with specific children deepens as the narrative evolves. A Jewish man, now 63 years old, he finds his own religious speculations growing interwoven with the moral and religious explorations of the children, some of whom have been his friends for nearly seven years. The children change, of course, from year to year as they learn more about the world; but the author is changed also by the generous and tender ways in which the children, step by step, unlock their secrets and unveil the mysteries of their belief to him."," Social Science , Sociology , Urban",2000

With Liberty and Justice for All: A Life Spent Protecting the Right to Choose,"By Michelman, Kate","Catalyzed by a pre-Roe v. Wade abortion, which required the consent of the husband who left her and the approval of a hospital panel made up entirely of men, Kate Michelman - seasoned lobbyist, skilled political strategist, and inspiration to millions of women across the country - has since devoted her life to protecting the rights of women and children. As president of NARAL Pro-Choice America from 1985 to 2004, Michelman catapulted the organization to prominence as the nation's premier reproductive rights group, moving the question ""Who decides?"" to the mainstream, transforming the political debate, and defining a woman's freedom to choose as a fundamental American liberty.Now, in a book that is at once personally compelling and urgently relevant, Michelman offers a wake-up call to American women to defend their freedom in what is undoubtedly its hour of greatest danger: With the appointment of just one or two Supreme Court justices hostile to Roe v. Wade and the right to choose, Roe's protections may very well be lost, forcing women to live at the whim of politicians and affording them fewer reproductive rights than their mothers had thirty years ago.Politically impassioned, thought-provoking, and timely, With Liberty and Justice for All is not just a book about choice, but a book about freedom. It is a book about bringing children into a world under the best possible conditions, and about a woman's right to assume her equal place in American society."," Political Science , Political Process , Political Advocacy",2005

The United States of Wal-Mart,"By Dicker, John","An irreverent, hard-hitting examination of the world's largest-and most reviled-corporation, which reveals that while Wal-Mart's dominance may be providing consumers with cheap goods and plentiful jobs, it may also be breeding a culture of discontent.   It employs one of every 115 American workers. If it were a nation-state, it would be one of the world's top twenty economies. With yearly sales of nearly $260 billion and an average way of $8 an hour, Wal-Mart represents an unprecedented-and perhaps unstoppable-force in capitalism. And there have been few corporations that have evoked the same levels of reverence and ire.   The United States of Wal-Mart is a hard-hitting examination of how Sam Walton's empire has infiltrated not just the geography of America but also its consciousness. Peeling away layers of propaganda and politics, investigative journalist John Dicker reveals an American (and, increasingly, a global) story that has no clear-cut villains or heroes-one that could be the confused, complicated story of America itself.   Pitched battles between economic progress and quality of life, between the preservation of regional identity and national homogeneity, and between low prices and the dignity of the American worker are beginning to coalesce into an all-out war to define our modern era. And, Dicker argues, Wal-Mart is winning. Revealing that the company's business practices have been shaping American culture, including the nation's social, political, and industrial policy, The United States of Wal-Mart provides fresh insight into a controversy that isn't going away."," Business & Economics , Industries , Retailing",2005

Partnerships for Profit: Structuring and Managing Strategic Alliances,"By Lewis, Jordan D.","Faced with new levels of savage competition, tens of thousands of companies, including fierce competitors, are sharing their resources and expertise to develop new products, achieve larger scale economies, and gain access to new technology and new markets. These strategic alliances are justifiably hailed by many as the competitive weapon of the 1990s. But because they are blurring and reshaping the very structure and boundaries of corporations in unprecedented ways, the process of designing and managing these alliances confronts managers with the awesome task of inventing theory and practice on a daily basis. Up to now, they have had few places to turn for guidance.  In Partnerships for Profit, Jordan D. Lewis, an internationally recognized expert on strategic alliances, now provides the first full-scale analysis of this surging global phenomenon. During five years of intensive field research, including 500 interview hours with more than 100 executives from some 40 American, European, and Asian firms, Lewis has observed firsthand some of the most successful strategic alliances and alliance practitioners in the world. Drawing on the experiences of IBM, Fuji Xerox, Ford, Dow Chemical, Intel, Komatsu, Corning, Sony, Apple Computer, Ciba-Geigy, and many other companies, Lewis brilliantly describes in detail how managers at each of these pioneering firms structure and manage various kinds of alliances -- from informal cooperation, minority investments, and risk-sharing contracts to full-fledged joint ventures and strategic networks. Through actual examples, Lewis shows for the first time how alliance partners build trust, develop mutual understandings, and make joint decisions, and at the same time protect core interests and critical technology -- a major concern of direct competitors. Lewis explains how to avoid the ""Trojan horse"" blunder many American firms made when they gave their Asian manufacturing partners key information about tailoring their products to local preferences. Particularly important is an entire chapter devoted to working with other cultures. The employment of strategic alliances, Lewis concludes, requires nothing short of a revolution in the conduct of business. Unlike arm's length relations, in which initial commitments govern, alliances involve shared risks and ongoing mutual adjustments. Lewis shows how alliances inevitably shape the business strategy of an entire firm, since the decisions to target certain markets and commit resources involve groups of firms acting in concert. Finally, Lewis shows how the use of alliances will affect internal management policies and practices, especially methods to bring about an outward focus and overcome the ""not invented here"" syndrome. We have entered the age of strategic alliances."," Business & Economics , Advertising & Promotion",1990

"The Secret War Against Hanoi: Kennedy's and Johnson's Use of Spies, Saboteurs, and Covert Warriors In North Vietnam","By Shultz, Richard H.","From 1964 to 1972, the United States executed an extremely secret campaign of covert operations against North Vietnam.  Controlled by the Pentagon's Special Operations Group, under the cover name ""Studies and Observation Group"" (SOG), it was the United States' largest and most complex covert operation since World War II.  Because it was so highly classified and politically sensitive, once the war was over the story of SOG was buried deep in the vaults of the Pentagon--until Dr. Richard H. Shultz, Jr., one of the world's leading experts on SOG's activities in Southeast Asia, began his impressive investigative research and wide-ranging special interviews.  The Secret War Against Hanoi is based on thousands of pages of recently declassified top-secret SOG documents, as well as interviews with sixty officers who ran SOG's covert programs and the senior officials who directed this secret war, including Robert McNamara, Walt Rostow, Richard Helms, William Colby, William Westmoreland, and Victor Krulak.  It is the first-ever definitive and comprehensive account of the covert paramilitary and espionage campaign, with many eye-opening disclosures. Dr. Shultz reveals how in 1963, President Kennedy, dissatisfied with the CIA's ineffective guerrilla operations against North Vietnam, turned over operational control of the covert war to the Pentagon and demanded results.  Despite Kennedy's strong directive, those results were slow in coming.  United States policymakers and the senior military leadership had little interest in or understanding of special operations and resisted any expansion of the secret war.  When SOG finally did get started in January 1964, under newly inaugurated President Johnson, it was constantly hobbled by the micro-management of the National Security Council, State Department, and Pentagon leadership.  Despite these restraints, SOG conducted its intense secret war for eight years, through the Johnson and Nixon administrations, and managed to execute a range of operations, including the dispatch of numerous spies to North Vietnam and creation of a sophisticated triple-cross deception program: psychological warfare through a fabricated guerrilla movement, manipulation of North Vietnamese POWs and kidnapped citizens, and dirty tricks; commando raids against Hanoi's coast and navy; and operations on the Ho Chi Minh Trail to kill enemy soldiers and destroy supplies.  Ultimately, the Pentagon's spies, saboteurs, and secret warriors would produce both spectacular and disastrous results.  There are lessons to be learned from Washington's conduct of the secret war against Hanoi that will be valuable and valid for years to come for presidents who engage in covert special operations to meet twenty-first-century threats to vital U.S. interests."," History , Military , General",1999

The Light of Evening,"By O'Brien, Edna","In this contemporary story with universal resonance, Edna O'Brien delves deep into the intense relationship that exists between a mother and daughter who long for closeness yet remain eternally at odds.  From her hospital bed in Dublin, the ailing Dilly Macready eagerly awaits a visit from her long-estranged daughter, Eleanora.  Years before, Eleanora fled Ireland for London when her sensuous first novel caused a local scandal.  Eleanora's peripatetic life since then has brought international fame but personal heartbreak in her failed quest for love. Always, her mother beseeches her to return home, sending letters that are priceless in their mix of love, guilt, and recrimination. For all her disapproval, Dilly herself knows something of Eleanora's need for freedom: as a young woman in the 1920s, Dilly left Ireland for a new life in New York City. O'Brien's marvelous cinematic portrait of New York in that era is a tour-de-force, filled with the clang and clatter of the city, the camaraderie of the working girls against their callous employers, and their fierce competition over handsome young men. But a lover's betrayal sent Dilly reeling back to Ireland to raise a family on a lovely old farm named Rusheen. It is Rusheen that still holds mother and daughter together.  Yet Eleanora's visit to her mother’s sickbed does not prove to be the glad reunion that Dilly prayed for.  And in her hasty departure, Eleanora leaves behind a secret journal of their stormy relationship -- a revelation that brings the novel to a shocking close.Brimming with the lyricism and earthy insight that are the hallmarks of Edna O'Brien's acclaimed fiction, The Light of Evening is a novel of dreams and attachments, lamentations and betrayals.  At its core is the realization that the bond between mother and child is unbreakable, stronger even than death."," Fiction , Family Life",2007

Writings on an Ethical Life,"By Singer, Peter","Love him or hate him, you certainly can't ignore him. For the past twenty years, Australian philosopher and professor of bioethics Peter Singer has pushed the hot buttons of our collective conscience. In addition to writing the book that sparked the modern animal rights movement, Singer has challenged our most closely held beliefs on the sanctity of human life, the moral obligation's of citizens of affluent nations toward those living in the poorest countries of the world, and much more, with arguments that intrigue as often and as powerfully as they incite.Writings On An Ethical Life offers a comprehensive collection of Singer's best and most provocative writing, as chosen by Singer himself. Among the controversial subjects addressed are the moral status of animals, environmental account-ablility, abortion, infanticide, euthanasia, and the ultimate choice of living an ethical life. This book provides an unsurpassed one-volume view of both the underpinnings and the applications of Singer's governing philosophy."," Philosophy , Ethics & Moral Philosophy",2000

Imperial Grunts: The American Military on the Ground,"By Kaplan, Robert D.","In this landmark book, Robert D. Kaplan, veteran correspondent for The Atlantic Monthly and author of Balkan Ghosts, shows how American imperialism and the Global War on Terrorism are implemented on the ground, mission by mission, in the most exotic landscapes around the world. Given unprecedented access, Kaplan takes us from the jungles of the southern Philippines to the glacial dust bowls of Mongolia, from the forts of Afghanistan to the forests of South America–not to mention Iraq–to show us Army Special Forces, Marines, and other uniformed Americans carrying out the many facets of U.S. foreign policy: negotiating with tribal factions, storming terrorist redoubts, performing humanitarian missions and training foreign soldiers. In Imperial Grunts, Kaplan provides an unforgettable insider’s account not only of our current involvement in world affairs, but also of where America, including the culture of its officers and enlisted men, is headed. This is the rare book that has the potential to change the way readers view the men and women of the military, war, and the global reach of American imperialism today.As Kaplan writes, the only way to understand America’s military is “on foot, or in a Humvee, with the troops themselves, for even as elites in New York and Washington debated imperialism in grand, historical terms, individual marines, soldiers, airmen, and sailors–all the cultural repositories of America’s unique experience with freedom–were interpreting policy on their own, on the ground, in dozens upon dozens of countries every week, oblivious to such faraway discussions. . . . It was their stories I wanted to tell: from the ground up, at the point of contact.”Never before has America’s overarching military strategy been parsed so incisively and evocatively. Kaplan introduces us to lone American servicemen whose presence in obscure countries is largely unknown, and concludes with a heart-stopping portrait of marines in the first battle in Fallujah. Extraordinary in its scope, beautifully written, Imperial Grunts, the first of two volumes, combines first-rate reporting with the sensitivity and insights of an acclaimed writer steeped in history, literature, and philosophy, to deliver a masterly account of America’s global role in the twenty-first century. • Imperial Grunts paints a vivid picture of how defense policy is implemented at the grassroots level.• Kaplan travels throughout the world where U.S. forces are located. This is not just a book about Iraq or Afghanistan. • Rather than debate imperialism, Kaplan relies on a keen understanding of history, philosophy, and in-the-field reporting to show how it actually works on the ground.• Imperial Grunts escapes Washington and shows us what it’s like to live with the grunts day to day.Praise for Imperial Grunts“One of the most important books of the last several years. Robert Kaplan uses his prodigious energy and matchless reporting skills to takes us on to the front lines with the new warrior-diplomats who use weapons, imagination, and personal passion to protect and advance the interests of the United States. This is a generation every American should come to know.”–Tom Brokaw“Robert Kaplan has brilliantly captured the story of today’s U.S. military operating in far-flung places on strange missions. Imperial Grunts is the most insightful and superbly written account of soldiering in the New World Disorder to date. It is a must read for all Americans.”–General Anthony C. Zinni, United States Marine Corps (Ret.)“Kaplan infuses us with a sense of hope about the future. Through astonishing observations, truths, and stories, Imperial Grunts introduces a brand-new way of thinking about the enduring virtue of the American spirit.”–George Crile, author of Charlie Wilson’s War“No recent book so well or so vividly portrays the challenges of the modern United States military. With an impressive grasp of the complexities of military missions worldwide, Robert Kaplan exposes the reader to the world of the modern soldier, sailor, airman, and Marine. A must read for both civilian and military leaders.”–General Barry R. McCaffrey, United States Army (Ret.), Bradley Distinguished Professor of International Security Studies, United States Military Academy“Imperial Grunts is vintage Robert Kaplan, combining a deep appreciation of history and wonderfully vivid writing with an infectious wanderlust.”–Max Boot, Senior Fellow, National Security Studies, the Council on Foreign Relations, author of The Savage Wars of Peace“Splendid! This is the finest work in print about today’s American fighting men and the challenges they face around the globe. Kaplan’s courage in researching this book under combat conditions is complemented by his integrity and great literary skill. Imperial Grunts simply could not be better.”–Ralph Peters, author of Beyond Baghdad"," History , Military , General",2005

Sports from Hell: My Search for the World's Dumbest Competition,"By Reilly, Rick","The most popular sports columnist in America puts his life (and dignity) on the line in search of the most absurd sporting event on the planet.What is the stupidest sport in the world? Not content to pontificate from the sidelines, Rick Reilly set out on a global journey—with stops in Australia, New Zealand, Finland, Denmark, England, and even a maximum security prison at Angola, Louisiana—to discover the answer to this enduring question.  From the physically and mentally taxing sport of chess boxing to the psychological battlefield that is the rock-paper-scissors championship, to the underground world of illegal jart throwing, to several competitions that involve nudity, Reilly, in his valiant quest, subjected himself to both bodily danger and abject humiliation (or, in the case of ferret legging, both). These fringe sports offer their participants a chance to earn a few bucks and achieve the eternal glory that is winning—even when the victory in question might strike some as pointless, like the ability to sit in an oven-hot sauna for the longest time. It's debatable whether these sports push the body or just human idiocy to the outermost limits, but one thing is for sure: Sports in Hell is laugh-out-loud hilarious and will deliver plenty of unabashed fun."," Sports & Recreation , Essays",2010

Lanterns: A Memoir of Mentors,"By Edelman, Marian Wright","I am grateful beyond words for the example of the lanterns shared in this memoir whose lives I hope will illuminate my children's, your children's, and the paths of countless others coming behind.--Marian Wright Edelman, from the PrefaceMarian Wright Edelman, ""the most influential children's advocate in the country"" (The Washington Post), shares stories from her life at the center of this century's most dramatic civil rights struggles. She pays tribute to the extraordinary personal mentors who helped light her way: Martin Luther King, Jr., Robert F. Kennedy, Fannie Lou Hamer, William Sloane Coffin, Ella Baker, Mae Bertha Carter, and many others.She celebrates the lives of the great Black women of Bennettsville, South Carolina-Miz Tee, Miz Lucy, Miz Kate-who along with her parents formed a formidable and loving network of community support for the young Marian Wright as a Black girl growing up in the segregated South. We follow the author to Spelman College in the late 1950s, when the school was a hotbed of civil rights activism, and where, through excerpts from her honest and passionate college journal, we witness a national leader in the making and meet the people who inspired and empowered her, including Dr. Benjamin E. Mays, Howard Zinn, and Charles E. Merrill, Jr.Lanterns takes us to Mississippi in the 1960s, where Edelman was the first and only Black woman lawyer. Her account of those years is a riveting first-hand addition to the literature of civil rights: ""The only person I recognized in the menacing crowd as I walked towards the front courthouse steps was [a] veteran New York Times reporter. He neither acknowledged me nor met my eyes. I knew then what it was like to be a poor Black person in Mississippi: alone."" And we follow Edelman as she leads Bobby Kennedy on his fateful trip to see Mississippi poverty and hunger for himself, a powerful personal experience for the young RFK that helped awaken a nation's conscience to child hunger and poverty. Lanterns is illustrated with thirty of the author's personal photographs and includes ""A Parent's Pledge"" and ""Twenty-five More Lessons for Life,"" an inspiration to all of us-parents, grandparents, teachers, religious and civic leaders-to guide, protect, and love our children every day so that they will become, in Marian Wright Edelman's moving vision, the healing agents for national transformation."," Political Science , Civil Rights",1999

They say that Falun Gong has become a dangerous threat to the largest nation on Earth. In a return to the dark days of the Cultural Revolution, they have burned thousands of Falun Gong books and literature. They have beaten and detained thousands of practitioners. They have issued an arrest warrant for Falun Gong founder Li Hongzhi. They are sentencing some practioners to long periods of incarceration at show trials. World leaders and human rights groups are speaking out.Why is this happening? Is it because Falun Gong has attracted an estimated l00 million practitioners? What is Falun Gong's appeal? What is it that China fears?This is their story. Largely Unheard. Until Now.This timely non-fiction book presents the inside story of China's crackdown on Falun Gong, taking a stand against the most blatant and pervasive political book burning since the days of Hitler's rise to power. By offering Falun Gong's story in the context of the current crisis in China, it provides an important look at a dramatic underreported and unfolding story.

Living the Bill of Rights: How to Be an Authentic American,"By Hentoff, Nat","Nat Hentoff is one of America&#39;s foremost and most passsionate writers about civil liberties and civil rights. In Living the Bill of Rights, he has taken what is too often thought of as an abstract issue and enlivened it by focusing on representative individuals for whom the Constitution is a vital part of life.  As the late Supreme Court Justice William Brennan told Hentoff, Americans need to know how :American liberties were won--and what it takes to keep them alive...and about the actual people  who are not afraid to fight to keep on being free Americans."" Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy underlined this need when he wrote, ""The Constitution needs allegiance and loyalty and renewal and understanding each generation, or else it&#39;s not going to last.""  With characteristic eloquence, Hentoff covers the full range of American life in these inspiring and moving profiles and stories and portrays such fighters for the Bill of Rights as a high school senior in Tennessee who is born-again Christian; a black Texas lawyer fired by the local NAACP for representing a Klan wizard on constitutional grounds; Justice William Brennan himself; another Supreme Court Justice, William O. Douglas, the preeminent; and a professional basketball star who, for religious reasons, would not participate in a display of mass loyalty to the American flag. Adding to the book&#39;s breadth are stories about such additional public and private heroes as Dr. Kenneth Clark, a resolute African-American school integrationist when more and more Americans, including some blacks, are abandoning that goal; a Jewish teacher at a black university who spoke out compellingly against black anti-Semitism; a young white mother who refused to allow anyone to stereotype her or her children by their color; a black high school student who did not stand for the Pledge of Allegiance because she believes there is not equal justice for all in this land; and finally, among other paladins of liberty, a Southern lawyer with clients on death row whom he will not abandon.  In Living the Bill of Rights, Hentoff illuminates the basic necessity--and fragility--of our rights and liberties."," Political Science , Constitutions",1998

He believes that's where God meets you--in the midst of honest grappling with heartfelt issues. In this remarkable book, Dr. Johnson discloses his deeply personal journey of faith. With the same keen mind accustomed to medical and scientific examination, he investigates the plausibility of God's existence and explores the significance of the person of Jesus. Despite all the difficulties of faith, he explains what he believes and why. He writes,""As a physician, I have committed my professional life to healing and wellness. But my public work is only a small part of who I really am--or rather, who I want to be. This book is, in a sense, 'the rest of the story.'""For many people, religion provides answers to the big questions of life. For others, the absolute claims of religion raise more questions than they answer. I have lived on both sides--and in some senses, I still do. My path of faith has wandered through both doubt and belief, often at the same time.""Doubt doesn't have to tear down belief, however; it can purify it. When it does, the beliefs on the other side become more certain. This is why I would like to affirm that it is possible to find God even while you are still asking the big questions.""Come join a fellow pilgrim on the journey.

A Rope and a Prayer: A Kidnapping from Two Sides,"By Rohde, David and Mulvihill, Kristen","The compelling and insightful account of a New York Times reporter's abduction by the Taliban, and his wife's struggle to free him.  Invited to an interview by a Taliban commander, New York Times reporter David Rohde and two Afghan colleagues were kidnapped in November 2008 and spirited to the tribal areas of Pakistan. For the next seven months, they lived in an alternate reality, ruled by jihadists, in which paranoia, conspiracy theories, and shifting alliances abounded. Held in bustling towns, they found that Pakistan's powerful military turned a blind eye to a sprawling Taliban ministate that trained suicide bombers, plotted terrorist attacks, and helped shelter Osama bin Laden. In New York, David's wife of two months, Kristen Mulvihill, his family, and The New York Times struggled to navigate the labyrinth of issues that confront the relatives of hostages. Their methodical, Western approach made little impact on the complex mix of cruelty, irrationality, and criminality that characterizes the militant Islam espoused by David's captors. In the end, a stolen piece of rope and a prayer ended the captivity. The experience tested and strengthened Mulvihill and Rohde's relationship and exposed the failures of American effort in the region. The tale of those seven months is at once a love story and a reflection of the great cultural divide-and challenge-of our time."," Biography & Autobiography , Editors, Journalists, Publishers",2010

How Come? Planet Earth,"By Solomon, Debra (ILT) and Wollard, Kathy","Kids never stop asking questions. And Kathy Wollard, whose Los Angeles Times syndicated column ""How come?"" appears in newspapers around the world, never stops answering them. In five years since the first How Come? was published, Ms. Wollard has written hundreds of columns addressing the whys, whats, wheres, and hows sent in by her readers. A direct follow-up to the original How Come?, How Come? Planet Earth is packed with lively, engagingly written, and often wittily illustrated answers to questions that kids have about the natural world around them. There are questions about animals - Why are electric eels electrical? (the charges not only help them find their way around in the dark, but act as a defense system). About human body - Where does the fat go when you lose weight? (it's burned up inside the muscles for energy). About Earth science - Why are storm clouds gray? (they contain a lot of water, which absorbs more sunlight than an ordinary cloud does, so storm clouds appear ominously dark). And just about everyday stuff - How do they make chewing gum? Why are diamonds the hardest material on Earth? Why do dogs bark? For all kids who want to know (and all kids want to know), and for the parents who can't always explain it to them (no parents know every answer), How Come? Planet Earth is the perfect reference and companion."," Juvenile Nonfiction , Science & Nature , General",1999

Sneaking Into the Flying Circus: How the Media Turn Our Presidential Campaigns into Freak Shows,"By Pelosi, Alexandra","Alexandra Pelosi, creator of the Emmy award-winning film Journeys with George and of Diary of a Political Tourist, makes her literary debut with an intimate look at the frenzied and grueling underbelly of presidential campaigning and the puppet role of the media. Pelosi went along on the campaign trail in order to, as she puts it, ""document the absurd hazing rituals that our presidential candidates have to go through."" With this savvy, well-connected, and fearless guide, it's a rollicking, breakneck journey unlike any other.  Pelosi's one-on-one time with the 2004 presidential candidates affords an up-close perspective on the highs and lows of campaign life: the genuine thrill of seeing America, the unrelenting grind of endless campaign stops, the hope and heartache of poll results. While the candidates try to stick to tightly constructed scripts, Pelosi's nonnetwork angle makes for revealing portraits of the men who wanted to be president.  But even more, Pelosi's approach reveals fundamental flaws in the media's election coverage. A former member of the campaign press corps, she turns her gimlet eye on the media, which are busy enacting their own election-time rituals: ""Every election cycle journalists defy the theory of evolution, living sequestered on a bus, with no sleep, few showers, and tons of junk food, going town-to-town listening to the same speech over and over. You're stuck in this dysfunctional relationship between the news organization that has you there to do their bidding and the campaign that is trying to co-opt you.""  And herein lies Pelosi's driving point: politicians and journalists don't trust each other, and so, in election coverage and in politics in general, the press is utterly hamstrung. Since the candidates never say anything unscripted and the journalists have to make nice in order to maintain access, modern presidential campaigns have become little more than media events. Politicians and journalists alike are going through the motions, and the voters have no idea who the candidates really are.  But Pelosi says the public are not fools: ""Everyone knows that the media do not give them an accurate portrait of a person."" No wonder people are apathetic. But whose fault is it? Are the candidates driving people away from the political process, or are the media keeping them out?  Probing, insightful, and lively, Sneaking into the Flying Circus exposes the election process for what it is: a three-ring gala production that comes to town every four years. As a nation and an audience, we're often willing to suspend disbelief -- and we often can't resist when the clowns try to get us in on the act. It is, after all, the greatest show on earth."," Political Science , Political Ideologies , Democracy",2005
Connecting with God: A Spiritual Formation Guide (A Renovare Resource),"By Graybeal, Lynda L., Roller, Julia L., and Foster, Richard J. (INT)","How can we experience god? God has communicated with his people throughout the ages in many ways.

Divided into twelve chapters conveniently organized for individual or group study, each section explores a different area in which we can deepen our individual communion with God.

Foster and the team that developed The Renovaré Spiritual Formation Bible and the longstanding A Spiritual Formation Workbook, provide tangible lessons that help us become spiritually formed, conformed, and transformed into the image of Jesus Christ. Geared for either individual study or use in small groups, each Renovaré Spiritual Formation Guide explores one facet of our life with God, providing readings from Scripture as well as classic and contemporary works of spirituality. The combination of readings, reflection questions, exercises, and activities makes these books invaluable interactive guides that prompt true spiritual growth."," Religion , Biblical Commentary , General",2006

From Botswana to the Bering Sea: My Thirty Years With National Geographic,"By Canby, Thomas Y.","National Geographic has been called a window on the world and a passport to adventure. Each month an estimated forty million people in 190 countries open its pages and are transported to exotic realms that delight the eye and mind. Such widespread renown gives the magazine&#39;s writers an almost magical access to people and happenings, as doors that are closed to the rest of the journalistic world open wide.Thomas Y. Canby was fortunate to be a NationalGeographic writer and science editor from 1961 to 1991, a time during which the Society&#39;s ventures and size grew by leaps and bounds and the resources available to staff were seemingly limitless. In From Botswana to the Bering Sea, he gives readers an on-the-ground look at the life of a National Geographic field staffer and an insider&#39;s view of the fascinating dynamics within the magazine&#39;s editorial chambers.Canby&#39;s assignments dealt largely with issues of global concern, and his travels took him to the farthest reaches of the planet. This book gives the reader the visas and tickets to share in Canby&#39;s experiences -- from a Filipino rice harvest capped by a feast of deep-fried rats, to impoverished villages of Asia and Africa gripped by the world&#39;s most widespread famine, to seal hunting and dog sledding with Eskimos in the Canadian high Arctic. Readers match wits with paranoid guardians of the secret Soviet space program; skirt land mines in the flaming oil fields of Kuwait; and dodge death while scuba diving to an archaeological site in a Florida sinkhole. The book also gives insight into the magazine&#39;s inner workings: how article subjects are chosen; how writers are assigned and interact; how prolonged trips to impossibly remote destinations are planned; how staffers operate in the field.Working for National Geographic has been called ""the best job in the world."" From Botswana to the Bering Sea describes that unique job, and answers from first-hand knowledge the question Canby and his colleagues are so often asked: ""So, what is it like to work for National Geographic?"""," Nature , Environmental Conservation & Protection",1998

Dead End Gene Pool: A Memoir,"By Burden, Wendy","The great-great-great-great granddaughter of Cornelius Vanderbilt takes a look at the decline of her wealthy blue-blooded family in this irreverent and wickedly funny memoir  For generations the Burdens were one of the wealthiest families in New York, thanks to the inherited fortune of Cornelius ""The Commodore"" Vanderbilt. By 1955, the year of Wendy's birth, the Burdens had become a clan of overfunded, quirky and brainy, steadfastly chauvinistic, and ultimately doomed blue bloods on the verge of financial and moral decline-and were rarely seen not holding a drink.  When her father commits suicide when Wendy is six, she and her brother are told nothing about it and are shuffled off to school as if it were any other day. Subsequently, Wendy becomes obsessed with the macabre, modeling herself after Wednesday Addams of the Addams family, and decides she wants to be a mortician when she grows up. Just days after the funeral, her mother jets off to southern climes in search of the perfect tan, and for the next three years, Wendy and her two brothers are raised mostly by a chain-smoking Scottish nanny and the long suffering household staff at their grandparent's Fifth Avenue apartment. If you think Eloise wreaked havoc at The Plaza you should see what Wendy and her brothers do in ""Burdenland""-a world where her grandfather is the president of the Museum of Modern Art; the walls are decorated with originals of Klee, Kline, Mondrian, and Miro; and Rockefellers are regular dinner guests.  The spoiled life of the uber-rich that they live with their grandparents is in dark contrast to the life they live with their mother, a brilliant Radcliffe grad and Daughter of the American Revolution, who deals with having two men's suicides on her conscience by becoming skinnier, tanner, blonder, and more steeped in bitter alcoholism with every passing year.  We watch Wendy's family unravel as she travels between Fifth Avenue, Virginia horse country, Mount Desert Island in Maine, the Jupiter Island Club, London, and boarding school, coming through all of it surprisingly intact. Rife with humor, heartbreak, family intrigue, and booze, Dead End Gene Pool offers a glimpse into the eccentric excess of old money and gives truth to the old maxim: The rich are different.Watch a Video"," Social Science , Social Classes & Economic Disparity",2011

Men in Black Dresses: A Quest for the Future Among Wisdom-Makers of the Middle East,"By Seng, Yvonne, Ph.D.","If we pause long enough, we can hear, above the din of our planet's rapid globalization and technological advancement, the quiet voices of spiritual leaders from ancient faiths. Middle East historian Yvonne Seng asks, What can these modern Desert Fathers with their long history of survival advise us on the future of our planet? Her intellectual quest rapidly becomes a personal journey that turns her Western training and perceptions on their head.  Men In Black Dresses takes the reader behind the walls of desert monasteries, Sufi enclaves, ancient cathedrals and mosques -- where the author knocks, uninvited, and waits for the wise men to allow her in. Once inside, they discuss the universal concerns of the environment and the Internet, the building of a global community, and the education of coming generations, as well as the state of the human spirit."," Religion , Comparative Religion",2003

A Charmed Life: Growing Up in Macbeth's Castle,"By Campbell, Liza","A Charmed Life tells the story of Liza Campbell, the last child to be born at the impressive and renowned Cawdor Castle, the same locale featured in Shakespeare's Macbeth. It was at the historical ancestral home that Liza's seemingly idyllic fairytale childhood began to resemble a nightmare.     Increasingly overwhelmed by his enormous responsibilities, Liza's father Hugh, the twenty-fifth Thane of Cawdor, tipped into madness fueled by drink, drugs, and extramarital affairs. Over the years, the castle was transformed into an arena of reckless extravagance and terrifying domestic violence, as Liza and her siblings watched their father destroy himself, his family, and their centuries-old legacy.      Painstakingly honest, thoroughly entertaining, and sharply written, Campbell's contemporary fairytale tells of growing up as a maiden in a castle where ancient curses and grisly events from centuries ago live on between its stone walls.

VIVO [Voice-In/Voice-Out]: The Coming Age of Talking Computers,"By Crossman, William","A positive look at how talking computers, VIVOs, will make text/written language obsolete, replace all writing and reading with speech and graphics, democratize information flow worldwide, and recreate an oral culture by 2050. Text is an ancient technology for storing and retrieving information; VIVOs will do the same job more quickly, efficiently, and universally. Among VIVO’s potential benefits: 80% of the world’s people are functionally nonliterate; they will be able to use VIVOs to access all information without having to learn to read and write. VIVO’s instantaneous translation function will let people speak with other people around the world using their own native languages. People whose disabilities prevent them from reading and/or writing will be able to access all information. Four “engines” are driving us irreversibly into the VIVO Age and oral culture: human evolution, technological breakthroughs, young people’s rejection of text, and people’s demand for textless, universal access to information. Future generations, using eight key VIVOlutionary learning skills, will radically change education, human relations, politics, the arts, business, our relation to the environment, and even human consciousness itself. Worldwide access to VIVO technology looms as a key human rights issue of the 21st Century."," Computers , Social Aspects , General",2004

The Sacrificial Mother: Escaping the Trap of Self-Denial,"By Rubenstein, Carin, Ph.D.","Based on extensive research into the lives and emotions of thousands of women, this book identifies the dangers of the sacrifice syndrome for mothers and shows them how to escape it. Using dramatic examples from many women's lives, Rubenstein exposes the toll that self-denial takes on women and their families when they fool themselves into thinking that sacrifice will make them better mothers. There's the true story of the woman who worked a full-time job all night, but refused to sleep so that she could take care of her children during the day. Many mothers choose less drastic ways of sacrificing, like the woman who got up early on Thanksgiving day to cook a turkey because her husband insisted on smelling it, even though they were going out for the holiday dinner.The author shows how making a habit of sacrifice can destroy self-esteem and wear women down; she also advises women how to incorporate into their lives some time and nurturing for themselves. She reveals the benefits of becoming just a bit more selfist - taking care of one's self - instead of being overly sacrificial. And she unveils the startling news that being less sacrificial actually makes for much healthier and happier relationships with both husband and children."," Family & Relationships , Parenting , Motherhood",1998

As these painful trials are allowed into our life He promises we will never suffer in vain."," Religion , Christian Living , General",2003

""I'd be a lot happier now if I had that time and that money back."" Ilene Beckerman has lived long enough to have finally learned that there's more to happiness than finding the right hairdo and maintaining an ideal weight. This is never more clear than when she's invited to her fiftieth elementary-school reunion. ""Of course I'd go to the reunion."" Beckerman says. But delight soon turns to dismay: ""I wondered who'd be there. How would they look? Would I look as good? What would I wear? Could I lose twenty pounds by June?"" Her reunion presents the perfect occasion to illustrate the anxieties and doubts, the dreams and hard-earned triumphs, of women—from Queen Victoria to Britney Spears.

Difficult Transitions: Foreign Policy Troubles at the Outset of Presidential Power,"By Campbell, Kurt M. and Steinberg, James B.","New presidents have no honeymoon when it comes to foreign policy. Less than three months into his presidency, for example, John F. Kennedy authorized the disastrous effort to overthrow Fidel Castro at the Bay of Pigs. More recently, George W. Bush had been in office for less than eight months when he was faced with the attacks of September 11. How should an incoming president prepare for the foreign policy challenges that lie immediately ahead? That's the question Kurt Campbell and James Steinberg tackle in this compelling book.   Drawing on their decades of government service&#151;in the corridors of Capitol Hill, the intimate confines of the White House, the State Department, and the bare-knuckles Pentagon bureaucracy&#151;Campbell and Steinberg identify the major foreign policy pitfalls that face a new presidential administration. They explain clearly and concisely what it takes to get foreign policy right from the start.  The authors set the scene with a historical overview of presidential transitions and foreign policy including case studies of such prominent episodes as the ""Black Hawk Down"" tragedy in Somalia that shook the Clinton administration in its first year and the Bush administration's handling of the collision between a U.S. reconnaissance plane and a Chinese fighter jet in the spring of 2001. They pinpoint the leading causes of foreign policy fiascos, including the tendency to write off the policies of the outgoing administration and the failure to appreciate the differences between campaign promises and policy realities. Most important, they provide a road map to help the new administration steer clear of the land mines ahead.  America's next president will confront critical foreign policy decisions from day one. Dif ficult Transitions provides essential guidance for getting those choices right."," Political Science , American Government , Executive Branch",2008
"The Battle of Alamein: Turning Point, World War II","By Smith, Colin and Bierman, John","In the most devastating global conflict in history, the Battle of Alamein stands out as one of the great triumphs of the Allied forces. In October 1942, the little Egyptian railway stop became the showdown between two legendary commanders - German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, the notorious ""Desert Fox,"" and British Lieutenant General Bernard ""Monty"" Montgomery. When Rommel's Panzerarmee Afrika clashed with the imperial British forces under Monty, the entire dynamic of World War II changed. Now, in this account, John Bierman and Colin Smith unfold the whole story of the decisive campaigns of the desert war, from the Italian invasion of Egypt in September 1940 to the mass surrender of the Axis forces in Tunis in May 1943.Writing with great verve, Bierman and Smith create a stunning panorama peopled by some of the most glamorous, dangerous, and mysterious figures in the war, drawing on extensive and hitherto overlooked primary sources, including battle reports, regimental histories, and interviews with veterans from all sides of the conflict. The story reads like a great war novel as the two sides chase each other back and forth across an unforgiving North African landscape. They shed new light on the remarkable story of Rommel's desert advisor, the shady Hungarian adventurer Laszlo Almasy, who was recast as the romantic English patient in Michael Ondaatje's novel. They also tell the story of the secret war fought by a group of German Jewish volunteers from Palestine and the strange tale of the unfortunate American colonel who became an unwilling source of intelligence for the Nazis.The picture is large in scope, juxtaposing the designs and delusions of grand strategy against the courage, chaos, and confusion of individuals in combat. At Alamein, Nazi Germany's hitherto unbroken succession of land victories was finally reversed, and the mightiest war machine the world had ever seen suffered its first major defeat. This riveting account is military history at its absolute best."," History , Military , World War I",2002

Evil: An Investigation,"By Morrow, Lance","Long couched only in theological terms, and popularly personified by the despots of history, the nature of evil has resisted explanation. In this singular survey of this mysterious but all too often palpable force, veteran Time magazine writer Lance Morrow examines the unmistakable ways evil influences our global culture-and how that global culture in turn has magnified evil's menace. Its dramatic reemergence in the national consciousness-against a backdrop of high-tech, sensationalized violence-makes his updated understanding both timely and absolutely necessary.Drawing on examples both obscure and splashed across the headlines, Morrow seeks to understand how evil works, and what purpose, if any, it serves. From the heartrending to the harrowing, from quiet lies to catastrophic acts, his stories are drawn from over thirty years of experience as a revered journalist and essayist. The result is a brilliant synthesis of a lifetime of observation that elegantly illuminates a chronically elusive but fascinating subject."," Philosophy , Ethics & Moral Philosophy",2003

The Fire of His Genius: Robert Fulton and the American Dream,"By Sale, Kirkpatrick","None of the well-dressed crowd that gathered on the Hudson River side of Lower Manhattan on the hot afternoon of August 17, 1808, could have known the importance of the object they had come to see and, mostly, deride: Robert Fulton's new steamboat, the North River, the boat that is frequently -- and wrongly -- remembered as the Clermont. But, as Kirkpatrick Sale shows in this remarkable biography of Fulton, the North River's successful four-day round-trip to Albany proved a technology that would transform nineteenth-century America, open up the interior to huge waves of settlers, create and sustain industrial and plantation economies in the nation's heartland, and destroy the remaining Indian civilizations and most of the wild lands on which they depended. The North River's four-day trip introduced the machines and culture that marked the birth of the Industrial Revolution in America.  The Fire of His Genius tells the story of the extraordinarily driven and ambitious inventor who brought all this about, probing into the undoubted genius of his mind but, too, laying bare the darker side of the man -- and the darker side of the American dream that inspired him. It depicts one of America's earliest heroes both at the pinnacle of creativity and success, fame, and fortune and in the depths of solitude, recklessness, and contentiousness that preceded his early death (Fulton spent much of his life defending patents for everything from rope-making machinery to submarines to proto-torpedoes that he attempted to sell, in succession, to the French, the British, and the American navies). All this is set against a brilliant portrait of a dynamic historical period filled with characters from Bonaparte to Jefferson, Cornelius Vanderbilt to Meriwether Lewis, Robert Livingston to Benjamin West, and events from the Lewis and Clark expedition to the War of 1812, the Louisiana Purchase to the bombing of Fort McHenry, the treasontrial of Aaron Burr to the ""Great Removal"" of American Indians. Here are the ""taming"" of America's rivers and the building of its great canals, the introduction to every body of water of Fulton's ""large, noisy, showy, fast, brash, exciting, powerful, and audacious"" machine that was the very embodiment of America. A biography that bears comparison to the best work of David McCullough, Dava Sobel, and Garry Wills, The Fire of His Genius is a remarkable achievement: an extraordinarily clear window into an extraordinary time told with deftness, zest, and unflagging verve."," Biography & Autobiography , Science & Technology",2001

Beyond Tallulah: How Sam Wyly Became America's Boldest Big-Time Entrepreneur,"By Wyly, Sam and Hamilton, Dennis","Beyond Tallulah, the illustrated biography of Sam Wyly, the most versatile big-company entrepreneur in American history, tells one of the most compelling untold business stories of our time. Wyly has built 10 companies in nine different industries with 500 million- or billion-dollar valuations. He’s the reason that Bonanza Steakhouse, Michaels Arts & Crafts and Green Mountain Energy are household names today. And his achievements serve as a valuable point of reference for today’s generation of recession-fighting Start-up Whiz Kids.After a mercurial rise through the early computer industry in Texas, Wyly founded a data transmission company (DATRAN) with the dream of building a network of microwave towers that would enable computers to talk to each other wirelessly—20 years before the World Wide Web existed. What happened next is a case study of high-wire business dealings that speaks to the core values of American enterprise. Wyly’s dealings with entrenched interests foreshadow the tough questions faced by today’s readership about the proper roles of government and business in rebuilding the country. As Wyly struggled to recover from disastrous setbacks, he never stopped asking, “What's next?”With exclusive access to Wyly and original interviews of more than one hundred of his colleagues and family members, biographer Dennis Hamilton draws an energetic and fast-paced portrait of a business career that soared high, courted disaster and carved a memorable path through five decades. In the end, this story of an American titan of industry is made distinctive—and memorable—through the details readers learn about Wyly’s deft, sure-handed approach to deal making and a seeming sixth sense for the ebbs and flows of the financial market.In Beyond Tallulah, we watch Wyly journey from small-town high school football in the South to IBM in its Information Age heyday, from the takeover wars of the 1980s to adventures in big-scale national retailing, from the Alaska pipeline to a new generation of clean energy. Wyly’s life promises to fascinate and inspire readers, while also serving as a blueprint for aspiring entrepreneurs. Illustrated with more than two hundred color and black-and-white photos, Beyond Tallulah preserves Wyly’s wholly original American journey—from his dirt poor Great Depression childhood in rural Louisiana to his triumph as a self-made billionaire . . . six times.Born in 1934, Sam Wyly was raised in rural Louisiana. In 1957, he received his MBA from the University of Michigan's Business School and began his career as a salesman for IBM and then for Honeywell. Six years later, at the age of 28, Wyly was out on his own, creating his first company, University Computing, which offered computer services to local businesses. Over the course of the next 50 years, he founded or grew successful companies in computing, computer software products, oil refining, insurance, steakhouse franchising, arts-and-crafts retailing, hedge fund investing, environmentally friendly electricity, and carbon offsets.In addition to being an entrepreneur, Wyly invests his time in educational institutions and has served as a trustee of Southern Methodist University, as vice chairman of the Princeton Parents Association, and on the board of PBS. One of Wyly’s proudest endeavors was providing the start-up capital for the Dallas PBS station to create a high-quality news program in 1968. The show was called Newsroom, which evolved into what’s known today as NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, one of the most trusted news sources for millions nationwide.Over his storied career, Wyly has received many accolades and awards. Forbes named him one of its 10 greenest billionaires in 2010. In 2003, Wyly received the Murphy Award for Lifetime Achievement in Entrepreneurship from the University of North Texas Murphy Enterprise Center; in 1997, the Woodrow Wilson Award for Corporate Citizenship and the David D. Alger Award from the University of Michigan Business School; and in 1970, the Horatio Alger Award and Entrepreneur of the Year honor from Southern Methodist University. In 1968, he was named “One of Ten Outstanding Young Men in America” by U.S. Jaycees and in 1967, “One of Five Outstanding Young Texans” by Texas Jaycees. In 2002, Wyly was interviewed by David Allison from The Smithsonian Museum as part of an oral history project  about the origins of the computing industry.Today, Wyly is an active philanthropist, an avid reader and a family man. He resides with his wife, Cheryl, in Dallas and in Aspen, Colorado. They own an independent bookstore, Explore Booksellers. Wyly has six children, eleven grandchildren, and two great grandchildren. He is the author of a memoir, 1,000 Dollars & an Idea."," Biography & Autobiography , Business",2011
"Never Eat Alone: And Other Secrets to Success, One Relationship at a Time","By Ferrazzi, Keith and Raz, Tahl","Do you want to get ahead in life? Climb the ladder to personal success? The secret, master networker Keith Ferrazzi claims, is in reaching out to other people. As Ferrazzi discovered early in life, what distinguishes highly successful people from everyone else is the way they use the power of relationships—so that everyone wins.In Never Eat Alone, Ferrazzi lays out the specific steps—and inner mindset—he uses to reach out to connect with the thousands of colleagues, friends, and associates on his Rolodex, people he has helped and who have helped him.The son of a small-town steelworker and a cleaning lady, Ferrazzi first used his remarkable ability to connect with others to pave the way to a scholarship at Yale, a Harvard MBA, and several top executive posts. Not yet out of his thirties, he developed a network of relationships that stretched from Washington’s corridors of power to Hollywood’s A-list, leading to him being named one of Crain’s 40 Under 40 and selected as a Global Leader for Tomorrow by the Davos World Economic Forum.Ferrazzi's form of connecting to the world around him is based on generosity, helping friends connect with other friends. Ferrazzi distinguishes genuine relationship-building from the crude, desperate glad-handling usually associated with “networking.” He then distills his system of reaching out to people into practical, proven principles. Among them:Don’t keep score: It’s never simply about getting what you want. It’s about getting what you want and making sure that the people who are important to you get what they want, too.“Ping” constantly: The Ins and Outs of reaching out to those in your circle of contacts all the time—not just when you need something.Never eat alone: The dynamics of status are the same whether you’re working at a corporation or attending a society event— “invisibility” is a fate worse than failure.In the course of the book, Ferrazzi outlines the timeless strategies shared by the world’s most connected individuals, from Katherine Graham to Bill Clinton, Vernon Jordan to the Dalai Lama.Chock full of specific advice on handling rejection, getting past gatekeepers, becoming a “conference commando,” and more,Never Eat Alone is destined to take its place alongside How to Win Friends and Influence People as an inspirational classic."," Business & Economics , Careers , General",2005

At the age of fourteen, Marcus was suddenly thrust into the white world when he won an academic scholarship to Lawrenceville, one of the nation's most prestigious prep schools. As he excelled within Lawrenceville's ivy-clad halls, he grew painfully aware of the racial ignorance that shapes the lives of even the most well meaning people.Mabry's odyssey continued into his years at Stanford, where he became embroiled in the debate about political correctness, and then later at Newsweek, where as one of the very few minority journalists at a major newsmagazine he learned firsthand about the negative portrayals of African-Americans in the press."," Social Science , Anthropology , Cultural & Social",1995

He argues that Darwin’s disturbing picture of life, instead of being hostile to religion - as scientific skeptics and many believers have thought it to be - actually provides a most fertile setting for mature reflection on the idea of God. Solidly grounded in scholarship, Haught’s explanation of the relationship between theology and evolution is both accessible and engaging."," Religion , Education",2001

The East Asian Challenge for Human Rights,"By Bauer, Joanne R. (EDT) and Bell, Daniel A. (EDT)","The ""Asian values"" argument within the international human rights debate holds that not all Asian states should be expected to protect human rights to the same degree. This position of ""cultural relativism,"" often used by authoritarian governments in Asia to counter charges of human rights violations, has long been dismissed by Western and Asian human rights advocates as a weak excuse. This book moves beyond the politicized rhetoric that has dogged the international debate on human rights to identify the more persuasive contributions by East Asian intellectuals.  The editors of this book argue that critical intellectuals in East Asia have begun to chart a middle ground between the extreme, uncompromising ends of this argument, making particular headway in the areas of group rights and economic, social, and cultural (ethnic minority) rights.  The chapters form a collective intellectual inquiry into the following four areas:  critical perspectives on the ""Asian values"" debate; theoretical proposals for an improved international human rights regime with greater input from East Asians; the resources within East Asian cultural traditions that can help promote human rights in the region; and key human rights issues facing East Asia as a result of rapid economic growth in the region."," Political Science , Civil Rights",1999

Wiser in Battle: A Soldier's Story,"By Phillips, Donald T. and Sanchez, Ricardo S.","Amid all of the criticisms of America's war in Iraq, one essential voice has remained silent—until now. In his groundbreaking new memoir, Wiser in Battle, Lieutenant General Ricardo S. Sanchez, former commander of coalition forces in Iraq, reports back from the front lines of the global war on terror to provide a comprehensive and chilling exploration of America's historic military and foreign policy blunder.With unflinching candor, Sanchez describes the chaos on the Iraqi battlefield caused by the Bush administration's misguided command of the military, as well as his own struggle to set the coalition on the path toward victory. Sanchez illuminates the fallout of the communication breakdown between the leadership on the front and the politicians in Washington, revealing fractious discussions he had with, among others, Ambassador Paul Bremer and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.Drawing on his tenure on the ground, Sanchez shows how minor insurgent attacks grew into synchronized operations that finally ignited into a major insurgency and all-out civil war. He provides an insider's account of the Abu Ghraib prison scandal, explaining the circumstances that led to the abuses, who perpetrated them, and what the formal investigations revealed—all the while reflecting on America's objectionable use of torture and the grave need for the country's leadership to pursue an ethical course of action in the war on terror. Sanchez also details the cynical use of the Iraq War for political gain in Washington and shows how the pressure of an around-the-clock news cycle drove and distorted critical battle decisions, such as troop drawdowns, the fight for Fallujah, and the transfer of sovereignty.In addition, Sanchez shares the story of his career. He tells of the journey from his poverty-stricken youth on the Texas banks of the Rio Grande to joining the Reserve Officers' Training Corps at sixteen and later serving in Kosovo, Desert Shield and Desert Storm, and, ultimately, Iraq. At the time of his retirement, Sanchez was the highest-ranking Hispanic in the U.S. Army.The first book written by a former on-site commander in Iraq, Wiser in Battle is essential reading for all who wish to understand the current war and the American military's role in the new century."," Biography & Autobiography , Military",2008

Everybody knows one of them; in fact, you may even be one of them.  But now there's help for anyone who's ever fallen prey to businessese, academese, legalese, or any other ""ese"" when faced with a blank memo pad.

Written for busy professionals who want to improve the quality and clarity of their own (or their staff's) writing style, this no-nonsense guide is an indispensable office companion. Bailey's approach is 5urprisingly straightforward: just write as you would talk. Plain English is not only easier to read; it's also easier to write.  And it's so effective that many large organizations are endorsing, if not demanding, its use in the work place.  Pithy and entertaining, Bailey points out all the dos and don'ts of plain English.  He then illustrates them with examples drawn from a wide array of sources, including business documents, technical manuals, trade publications like Consumer Reports, and the works of writers such as Russell Baker and John D. MacDonald. From the basics to the fine tuning, he offers practical advice on clarity and precision, organization, layout, and a host of other important writing topics.      A delightful, down-to-earth guide, The Plain English Approach to Business Writing is for professionals of all backgrounds (government, military, legal, financial, technical, corporate) and staff at all levels (from the company CEO to the ambitious secretary).

You have to be the most athletic, you have to be able to have the most fun, you have to be the prettiest, the best dressed, the nicest, the most wanted. You have to constantly be out on the town partying, and then you have to get straight As. And most of all, you have to appear to be happy."" -- CJ, age seventeen High school isn't what it used to be. With record numbers of students competing fiercely to get into college, schools are no longer primarily places of learning. They're dog-eat-dog battlegrounds in which kids must set aside interests and passions in order to strategize over how to game the system. In this increasingly stressful environment, kids aren't defined by their character or hunger for knowledge, but by often arbitrary scores and statistics. In The Overachievers, journalist Alexandra Robbins delivers a poignant, funny, riveting narrative that explores how our high-stakes educational culture has spiraled out of control. During the year of her ten-year reunion, Robbins returns to her high school, where she follows students, including CJ and others:  Julie, a track and academic star who is terrified she's making the wrong choices; ""AP"" Frank, who grapples with horrifying parental pressure to succeed; Taylor, a soccer and lacrosse captain whose ambition threatens her popular girl status; Sam, who worries his years of overachieving will be wasted if he doesn't attend a name-brand college; Audrey, who struggles with perfectionism; and The Stealth Overachiever, a mystery junior who flies under the radar. Robbins tackles hard-hitting issues such as the student and teacher cheating epidemic, over-testing, sports rage, the black market for study drugs, and a college admissions process so cutthroat that some students are driven to depression and suicide because of a B. Even the earliest years of schooling have become insanely competitive, as Robbins learned when she gained unprecedented access into the inner workings of a prestigious Manhattan kindergarten admissions office. A compelling mix of fast-paced storytelling and engrossing investigative journalism, The Overachievers aims both to calm the admissions frenzy and to expose its escalating dangers."," Education , Higher",2007

The Rosedale Diet,"By Colman, Carol and Rosedale, Ron","Finally—the ultimate diet for fast, safe weight loss, lifelong health, and longer life, based on more than twenty years of research and the latest findings on appetite and weight. Metabolic specialist Ron Rosedale, M.D., has designed the Rosedale Diet to regulate the powerful hormone leptin, which controls appetite and weight loss by telling the brain when to eat, how much to eat—and when to stop. New research shows that leptin may be one of the body's most important hunger control mechanisms. Control leptin, and you control your weight.Most people's leptin levels are out of control, causing them to overeat and to store fat rather than burn it. The only way to flip the ""hunger switch"" back to normal is through a diet high in healthy fats and low in carbohydrates, saturated fat, and trans-fatty acids often found in processed food—plus just 15 minutes of daily exercise.Dr. Rosedale's 21-day diet plan is simple: Just select from the many foods on his ""A"" list, including ""healthy-fat"" foods such as avocados, nuts, olives, lobster, crab, shrimp, goat cheese, Cornish game hen, venison, and more. Then gradually add foods from the ""B"" list, such as steak, lamb chops, fruits, beans, and so on. A 28-day menu plan and more than 100 recipes, such as Dilled Salmon and Fresh Asparagus, Gingery Chicken Soup, Lasagna, Black Bean Wrap, Raspberry Mousse Cake, and French Silk Pie, make eating the Rosedale way deliciously easy.Weight loss is just the beginning. The Rosedale Diet will make you feel satisfied, reduce cravings, and put you in control of your ""sweet tooth."" It can even help eliminate or reduce heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and other conditions associated with ""natural"" aging, as many of Dr. Rosedale's patients can attest.

For generations, the Sawtelles have raised and trained a fictional breed of dog whose remarkable gift for companionship is epitomized by Almondine, Edgar's lifelong friend and ally. Edgar seems poised to carry on his family's traditions, but when catastrophe strikes, he finds his once-peaceful home engulfed in turmoil.Forced to flee into the vast wilderness lying beyond the Sawtelle farm, Edgar comes of age in the wild, fighting for his survival and that of the three yearling dogs who accompany him, until the day he is forced to choose between leaving forever or returning home to confront the mysteries he has left unsolved.Filled with breathtaking scenes—the elemental north woods, the sweep of seasons, an iconic American barn, a fateful vision rendered in the falling rain—The Story of Edgar Sawtelle is a meditation on the limits of language and what lies beyond, a brilliantly inventive retelling of an ancient story, and an epic tale of devotion, betrayal, and courage in the American heartland."," Fiction , Family Life",2009

The Trouble with Islam: A Muslim's Call for Reform in Her Faith,"By Manji, Irshad","""I have to be honest with you. Islam is on very thin ice with me....Through our screaming self-pity and our conspicuous silences, we Muslims are conspiring against ourselves.  We're in crisis and we're dragging the rest of the world with us.  If ever there was a moment for an Islamic reformation, it's now.  For the love of God, what are we doing about it?""In blunt, provocative, and deeply personal terms, Irshad Manji unearths the troubling cornerstones of mainstream Islam today: tribal insularity, deep-seated anti-Semitism, and an uncritical acceptance of the Koran as the final, and therefore superior, manifesto of God. In this open letter to Muslims and non-Muslims alike, Manji asks arresting questions. ""Who is the real colonizer of Muslims - America or Arabia? Why are we all being held hostage by what's happening between the Palestinians and the Israelis?  Why are we squandering the talents of women, fully half of God's creation?  What's our excuse for reading the Koran literally when it's so contradictory and ambiguous?  Is that a heart attack you're having?  Make it fast.  Because if more of us don't speak out against the imperialists within Islam, these guys will walk away with the show.""Manji offers a practical vision of how the United States and its allies can help Muslims undertake a reformation that empowers women, promotes respect for religious minorities, and fosters a competition of ideas. Her vision revives Islam's lost tradition of independent thinking. This book will inspire struggling Muslims worldwide to revisit the foundations of their faith. It will also compel non-Muslims to start posing the important questions without fear of being deemed ""racists.""  In more ways than one, The Trouble with Islam is a clarion call for a fatwa-free future."," Religion , Islam , General",2004

The Faith of the American Soldier,"By Mansfield, Stephen","An exploration of the major wars in U.S. history as seen through the religious faith of the men and women serving in the military.  Since men and women in battle not only face the prospect of their own deaths but also must fashion a moral rationale for killing, the battlefield is often a place of tremendous religious transformation.  Do men and women at war revert to the faith of their youth or do they gravitate to the spirituality around them? Do they lose all faith in the face of horror, or do they piece together an informal faith that simply gets them through the fight? Are they better warriors and do they experience less post-traumatic stress if they believe their war is righteous and that they are agents of good? These are the questions Stephen Mansfield addresses in The Faith of the American Soldier.  The book opens with the core question which lies at the heart of the matter: what happens religiously to America's warriors when they go to battle, and what impact does this have on the nation's conduct of war? Mansfield surveys America's wars from a theological perspective in order to understand the theological framing and religious rationale for each, where they came from, and what effect they had on behavior on the battlefield.  Mansfield examines the religious nature of the warrior ethic today. There is a new generation on the battlefield now, one raised with less religious training and less connection to history than any that has come before. Soldiers are left to their own religious choices to frame their moral perspectives on war, on killing, and on the possibility of death. Mansfield explores these choices through the lens of his deep respect for the military-he comes from a long line of U.S. Army officers-and from his background as a Ph.D. in American history, and his more than twenty years' experience as a pastor."," Religion , Faith",2005

Scribbling the Cat: Travels with an African Soldier,"By Fuller, Alexandra","When Alexandra (""Bo"") Fuller was home in Zambia a few years ago, visiting her parents for Christmas, she asked her father about a nearby banana farmer who was known for being a ""tough bugger."" Her father's response was a warning to steer clear of him; he told Bo: ""Curiosity scribbled the cat."" Nonetheless, Fuller began her strange friendship with the man she calls K, a white African and veteran of the Rhodesian war. With the same fiercely beautiful prose that won her acclaim forDon't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight, Fuller here recounts her friendship with K.K is, seemingly, a man of contradictions: tattooed, battle scarred, and weathered by farm work, he is a lion of a man, feral and bulletproof. Yet he is also a born-again Christian, given to weeping when he recollects his failed romantic life, and more than anything else welling up inside with memories of battle. For his war, like all wars, was a brutal one, marked by racial strife, jungle battles, unimaginable tortures, and the murdering of innocent civilians—and K, like all the veterans of the war, has blood on his hands.Driven by K's memories, Fuller and K decide to enter the heart of darkness in the most literal way—by traveling from Zambia through Zimbabwe (formerly Rhodesia) and Mozambique to visit the scenes of the war and to meet other veterans. It is a strange journey into the past, one marked at once by somber reflections and odd humor and featuring characters such as Mapenga, a fellow veteran who lives with his pet lion on a little island in the middle of a lake and is known to cope with his personal demons by refusing to speak for days on end. What results from Fuller's journey is a remarkably unbiased and unsentimental glimpse of men who have killed, mutilated, tortured, and scrambled to survive during wartime and who now must attempt to live with their past and live past their sins. In these men, too, we get a glimpse of life in Africa, a land that besets its creatures with pests, plagues, and natural disasters, making the people there at once more hardened and more vulnerable than elsewhere.Scribbling the Cat is an engrossing and haunting look at war, Africa, and the lines of sanity."," Biography & Autobiography , Personal Memoirs",2005
The Dragon Queen (Tales of Guinevere),"By Borchardt, Alice","Arthur turned and strode toward us. He was magnificent, and I will never forget that, in that moment, I first loved him. And I believe--had I known what the future held for us: all the trouble, torment, battle, and grief of our lives--I still believe that I would have yielded my heart into his keeping as I did then . . .In a sweeping epic of the imagination, Alice Borchardt enters the wondrous realm of Arthurian legend and makes it her own. The Dragon Queen is the first volume in a trilogy of novels that boldly re-imagines Camelot--and casts Guinevere as a shrewd, strong-willed, magical warrior queen.Born into a world of terrible strife, where war is constant and weapons are never far from the hands of men or women, Guinevere, daughter of a mighty pagan queen, is a threat to her people and a prize to the dreaded sorcerer Merlin. Sent into hiding, she grows up under the protection of a shapeshifting man-wolf and an ornery Druid. But even on the remote coast of Scotland, where dragons feed and watch over her, she is not safe from the all-seeing High Druid Merlin. He knows the young beauty's destiny, and he will stop at nothing to prevent what has been foretold. For if Guinevere becomes Queen and Arthur, King, they will bring a peace to the land that will leave the power-hungry Merlin a shriveled magician in a weary cloak.Yet Guinevere possesses power of her own--dazzling power to rival even that of Merlin. Summoned from her home by forces she cannot fathom, she travels from the Underworld to an Otherworld of the Past, at each step calling on ancient powers to aid her way. When young Guinevere proves her mettle to an embarrassed Merlin, even her faithful dragon protectors cannot prevent the evil that the sorcerer rains down. Seeking revenge, Merlin banishes Arthur to a world from which the only escape is death. Now Guinevere must face Merlin's wrath without him--and prove that she is worthy of being Arthur's Queen.From the glass-roofed Great Hall at Tintigal to the lush garden forts of Wales, Alice Borchardt details the travels of Guinevere in a rich fabric of prose. The Dragon Queen is a novel of great emotional depth, timeless romance, and soul-stirring adventure.From the Hardcover edition."," Fiction , Fantasy , Historical",2003

Bacchus & Me: Adventures in the Wine Cellar,"By McInerney, Jay","With acerbic wit, irreverent tone, and bountiful hilarious anecdotes,  Jay McInerney writes the first wine book that makes sense to all those  dazed by the prevailing, dull technical wine writing. McInerney  generously reveals all he's learned on his worldwide journey to  understand wine in chapters on reds, whites, dessert wines, champagne,  aperitifs, and more.  McInerney holds forth in forty-nine essays - with  agile humor; an astonishing amount of hard fact, and an ample dose of  personal taste - on: how to make your way around a German wine label;  what to drink with Thanksgiving turkey; the truth about Zinfandels; why  Burgundy is so hard to predict; Napa Valley's finest winemakers; the  pleasure of flinty Chablis, the deep satisfaction of port, the glorious  potential of Oregon's Pinot Noir; the respectability of RosT; and the  most colorful characters in the business. It is actually possible for a  reader of Bacchus & Me to take what is learned to the bank, and  immediately thereafter to wine shop or restaurant to indulge in the wine  of his or her fantasy with the confidence of a sommelier. Bacchus &  Me is for everyone interested in learning more about the wines of the  world. For both those of broad means and of modest purse, there is  intense vicarious pleasure to be found in McInerney's vinous adventures."," Cooking , Beverages , Wine & Spirits",2000

See No Evil: The True Story of a Ground Soldier in the CIA's War on Terrorism,"By Baer, Robert","In his explosive New York Times bestseller, top CIA operative Robert Baer paints a chilling picture of how terrorism works on the inside and provides startling evidence of how Washington politics sabotaged the CIA’s efforts to root out the world’s deadliest terrorists, allowing for the rise of Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda and the continued entrenchment of Saddam Hussein in Iraq.A veteran case officer in the CIA’s Directorate of Operations in the Middle East, Baer witnessed the rise of terrorism first hand and the CIA’s inadequate response to it, leading to the attacks of September 11, 2001. This riveting book is both an indictment of an agency that lost its way and an unprecedented look at the roots of modern terrorism, and includes a new afterword in which Baer speaks out about the American war on terrorism and its profound implications throughout the Middle East.“Robert Baer was considered perhaps the best on-the-ground field officer in the Middle East.”–Seymour M. Hersh, The New YorkerFrom The PrefaceThis book is a memoir of one foot soldier’s career in the other cold war, the one against terrorist networks. It’s a story about places most Americans will never travel to, about people many Americans would prefer to think we don’t need to do business with.This memoir, I hope, will show the reader how spying is supposed to work, where the CIA lost its way, and how we can bring it back again. But I hope this book will accomplish one more purpose as well: I hope it will show why I am angry about what happened to the CIA. And I want to show why every American and everyone who cares about the preservation of this country should be angry and alarmed, too.The CIA was systematically destroyed by political correctness, by petty Beltway wars, by careerism, and much more. At a time when terrorist threats were compounding globally, the agency that should have been monitoring them was being scrubbed clean instead. Americans were making too much money to bother. Life was good. The White House and the National Security Council became cathedrals of commerce where the interests of big business outweighed the interests of protecting American citizens at home and abroad. Defanged and dispirited, the CIA went along for the ride. And then on September 11, 2001, the reckoning for such vast carelessness was presented for all the world to see."," Political Science , Terrorism",2003

Home Lands: Portraits of the New Jewish Diaspora,"By Tye, Larry","The idea for this book came to Larry Tye as he traveled overseas as a reporter for the Boston Globe. In each city he visited he was intrigued by a reawakening of practice and spirit of the long repressed Jewish community. And the more communities he saw close-up, the clearer it became to him that the Jewish world was being reshaped and revitalized in ways that were not reflected in what he was reading about the disappearing diaspora and the vanishing Jews of America.The result is Home Lands, an narrative that tells the story of the new Jewish diaspora. Tye picked seven Jewish communities from Boston to Buenos Aires and Dusseldorf to Dnepropetrovsk deep in the Ukraine, and in each he zeroes in on a single family or congregation whose tale reflects the wider community's history and current situation. He met each community's leaders, talked with their scores of young people and old, and went with them to High Holiday services and Sabbath celebrations.The first impression that emerges from his travels is each city's uniqueness. Far more striking than the differences, however, is the unity. Jews all over the world still have enough customs and rituals in common for outsiders to see them as part of the same people, and for them to define themselves that way. It is that new comfort level, that sense of finally feel comfortable in the lands where they are living, that is at the heart of this engrossing book. Readers' eyes will be opened to how Germany, just a generation after the genocide, has the world's fastest-growing Jewish population; how the Jews of Buenos Aires have carved a place for themselves in a land that also gave refuge to Nazi henchmen like Adolph Eichman, and how Ireland is home to a tight-knit Jewish community that, remarkably, has produced Jewish Lord Mayors in Belfast, Cork and, twice from the same family, in Dublin. In Boston, Tye tells the story of his own family, whose roots run deep in the city's Jewish community.Home Lands is a book that is deeply personal even as it sheds light on the larger Jewish experience."," History , Middle East , Israel & Palestine",2001

Nilda,"By Mohr, Nicholasa","""Damn you bastards, coming here making trouble. Bunch of animals."" The two police offers responding to a call about an open fire hydrant lash out furiously at the Puerto Rican residents of New York City’s El Barrio neighborhood.  It's the summer of 1941, and all ten-year-old Nilda wants to do is enjoy the cool water with her friends. But the policemen’s curses end their fun, and their animosity is played out over and over again in Nilda’s life.  She is repeatedly treated with contempt and even disgust by adults in positions of authority: teachers, nurses and social workers.  At home, though, she is surrounded by a large and loving—if somewhat eccentric— family that supports and encourages her artistic abilities. She experiences the onset of World War II and watches anxiously as several brothers go off to war; her stepfather’s poor health means he can’t work, causing serious financial difficulties for the family; one brother slinks off to the underworld, leaving behind a pregnant girlfriend, adding two more mouths to feed to the family’s already dire situation.  Named an ""Outstanding Book of the Year"" by The New York Times and one of the ""Best Books of the Year"" by the American Library Association in 1973 when it was first published, Nicholasa Mohr’s classic novel about life as an immigrant in New York City offers a poignant look at one young girl’s experiences. Issues of race, religion and machismo are realistically and movingly depicted in this groundbreaking coming-of-age novel that was one of the first by a Latina author to be hailed by the mainstream media."," Young Adult Fiction , Classics",1985

America's Lighthouses: An Illustrated History (Dover Maritime),"By Holland, F. Ross","""A detailed, scholarly, masterly book…and yet the romance is still there."" — Chicago TribuneBeacons of light along the shore have guided mariners for thousands of years — from the days when olive oil lamps burned on darkened hillsides to signal the location of ancient harbors, to modern times when automated stations sent out 350,000 candlepower beams that cut through darkness and fog.The present volume, the first full-scale study of the United States Lighthouse Service, is a celebration of these vanishing symbols of security. Written by a historian of the National Park Service, this book describes the founding and operation of over 200 famous lights located along U.S. coastal and inland waterways. Beginning with the Boston Light, first lit in 1716, this carefully researched yet romantic account takes readers to every notable light installation in the nation — from New England to Delaware; the South Atlantic to the Florida Keys; the Gulf Coast; San Diego to Cape Flattery; the Great Lakes and Lake Champlain as well as Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.An informative section on lighthouse administration tells of the station's early days — when local authorities attempted to operate them — and their eventual takeover in 1939 by the U.S. Coast Guard. Subsequent chapters describe the development of diverse illumination systems as well as the vast number of changes and technological advances that have occurred in lighthouse construction and maintenance over the past century. In addition to its wealth of technical data, Dr. Holland's fascinating volume also includes dramatic vignettes — about heroic rescues of wreck-strewn sailors and valiant efforts to keep the lights shining in the face of human violence and natural calamity.This vivid, fact-filled history, enhanced by exciting tales and colorful personalities, is abundantly illustrated by over 100 historic engravings, drawings, and photographs. It is a book that will be prized not only by marine historians and armchair adventurers but by anyone who has ever felt the lure and romance of lighthouses — the lonely sentinels by the sea that have played such a crucial role in the maritime history of America and other sea-faring nations."," Transportation , Ships & Shipbuilding , History",1988

This is Marty's problem, and he finds it is one he has to face alone. When his solution gets too big for him to handle, things become more frightening still. Marty puts his courage on the line, and discovers in the process that it is not always easy to separate right from wrong.

High Tide in Tucson: Essays From Now Or Never,"By Kingsolver, Barbara and Mirocha, Paul (ILT)","Barbara Kingsolver has entertained and touched the lives of legions of readers with her critically acclaimed and bestselling novels The Bean Trees, Animal Dreams, and Pigs in Heaven. In these twenty-five newly conceived essays, she returns once again to her favored literary terrain to explore the themes of family, community, and the natural world. With the eyes of a scientist and the vision of a poet, Kingsolver writes about notions as diverse as modern motherhood, the history of private property, and the suspended citizenship of humans in the animal kingdom. Her canny pursuit of meaning from an inscrutable world compels us to find instructions for life in surprising places: a museum of atomic bomb relics, a West African voodoo love charm, a family of paper dolls, the ethics of a wild pig who persistently invades a garden, a battle of wills with a two-year-old, or a troop of oysters who observe high tide in the middle of Illinois.  In sharing her thoughts about the urgent business of being alive, Kingsolver the essayist employs the same keen eyes, persuasive tongue, and understanding heart that characterize her acclaimed fiction. Defiant, funny, courageously honest, High Tide in Tucson proves once again that ""there is no one quite like Barbara Kingsolver in contemporary literature.""--Washington Post Book World"," Literary Collections , Essays",1995

Jackpot Nation: Rambling and Gambling Across Our Landscape of Luck,"By Hoffer, Richard","Is this a great country or what? You can bet on the turn of the card, a roll of the dice—but also the NFL, the NCAA, and which Olson twin marries first. We bet $80 million a year, the amount growing wildly as more and more people gain access to this huge American wheel of fortune. No longer quarantined in Las Vegas, gambling has become as local as our neighborhood cineplex. It's no wonder that we spend more money gambling than we do on movies, music, sports, video games, and theme parks combined! If there's not a casino around the corner, there's one on your laptop computer. In Jackpot Nation, acclaimed Sports Illustrated writer Richard Hoffer takes us on a headlong tour, alternately horrifying and hilarious, across our landscape of luck, discovering just how ridiculously determined we are to gamble. Whether he's trying to win a side of bacon in a Minnesota bar, hustling a paper sack filled with $100,000 cash across Las Vegas parking lots, poring over expansion plans with a tribal chief in California, or visiting a retired bus salesman with a poor understanding of three-game parlays in his New York prison cell, Hoffer finds a national inclination—a cultural predisposition, even—to take a chance.Hoffer shows us how Americans—adventurers at heart—have embraced this ability to take recreational risks with a surprising gusto. But as he pokes into this country's far corners, traveling coast to coast with odds as his copilot, he uncovers more than just the playful exercise of that age-old fantasy—something for nothing. He discovers that the very institutions that used to regulate this workout are now its biggest cheerleaders. Whereas government, religion, and business once restricted our ability to gamble, making it  taboo even, they have now taken ownership of the pastime. Yesterday's numbers racket is today's state lottery; yesterday's mobbed-up casino is now part of a Fortune 500 company. It's one thing to recognize the house edge, but sometimes it's quite another to figure out who actually owns the house.Still, Hoffer manages to find the fun in all this, as equally delighted with the delirium of a slot machine trade show as the religious risk of an underground poker game, almost right beneath the spires of the Mormon Tabernacle. He concludes that people are, mostly, having a good time. If he also uncovers a downside—the outlandish vigorish that comes with its growing acceptance—well, that's why they call it gambling."," Social Science , Popular Culture",2007
